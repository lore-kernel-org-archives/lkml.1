Well that's a bit sad.

Could you please set up netconsole
(Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt) and add initcall_debug to the
kernel boot command line and then send us the full bootup logs?

(Even better: serial console with earlyprintk).

If that doesn't shed any light, we might have to ask you to perform a
git-bisect search to find the buggy commit, I'm afraid.
