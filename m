Dunno, still seems pretty pointless to me. The config option there
quotes memory consumption as the reason to reduce the number of sg
entries, however I think that's pretty silly. Additionally, a kernel
config entry just means that customers will be stuck with a fixed value
anyway. So I just don't see any merit to doing it that way either.
