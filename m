Subject: [PATCH 24/30] blk_end_request: add callback feature (take 4)

This patch adds a variant of the interface, blk_end_request_callback(),
which has driver callback feature.

Drivers may need to do special works between end_that_request_first()
and end_that_request_last().
For such drivers, blk_end_request_callback() allows it to pass
a callback function which is called between end_that_request_first()
and end_that_request_last().

This interface is only for fallback of other blk_end_request interfaces.
Drivers should avoid their tricky behaviors and use other interfaces
as much as possible.

Currently, only one driver, ide-cd, needs this interface.
So this interface should/will be removed, after the driver removes
such tricky behaviors.

o ide-cd (cdrom_newpc_intr())
  In PIO mode, cdrom_newpc_intr() needs to defer end_that_request_last()
  until the device clears DRQ_STAT and raises an interrupt after
  end_that_request_first().
  So end_that_request_first() and end_that_request_last() are called
  separately in cdrom_newpc_intr().

  This means blk_end_request_callback() has to return without
  completing request even if no leftover in the request.
  To satisfy the requirement, callback function has return value
  so that drivers can tell blk_end_request_callback() to return
  without completing request.
