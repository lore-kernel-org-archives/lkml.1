Seems fairly common in driver initialisation code.  I removed three
instances of this in the advansys driver.

Seems like you'd get a lot of false positives.  How about a call:

slab_warn_about_atomic_allocs();

right before calling the initcalls, and then

slab_stop_warning_about_atomic_allocs();

after calling them?  That should give people a lot to chew on for a few
months.  Obviously, you would need to not warn about allocations from
interrupt context, as you say above.
