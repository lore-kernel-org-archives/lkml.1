I suspect the correct fix would be to clean up the open API so that
NFSv4 doesn't have to hack its stateful open routine into the
->lookup() and ->d_revalidate() methods.

Having said that, doing revalidation for proc symlinks and bind mounts
(and not just for opens) might make sense.  This is something similar
to FS_REVAL_DOT, so perhaps make it conditional on this flag (or a
new, appropriately named one).

Thanks,
Miklos
