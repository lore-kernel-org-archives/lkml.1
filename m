} I don't have a problem with the sysadmin *telling* the system "the other
} end of
} that fiber cable has characteristics X, Y and Z".  What worried me was
} that it
} looked like conflating "device reported writeback cache" with "device
} actually
} has enough battery/hamster/whatever backup to flush everything on a power
} loss".
} (My back-of-envelope calculation shows for a worst-case of needing a 1ms
} seek
} for each 4K block, a 1G cache can take up to 4 1/2 minutes to sync.
} That's
} a lot of battery..)

Most hardware RAID devices I know of use the battery to save the cache while
the power is off.  When the power is restored it flushes the cache to disk.
If the power failure lasts longer than the batteries then the cache data is
lost, but the batteries last 24+ hours I beleve.

A big EMC array we had had enough battery power to power about 400 disks
while the 16 Gig of cache was flushed.  I think EMC told me the batteries
would last about 20 minutes.  I don't recall if the array was usable during
the 20 minutes.  We never tested a power failure.
