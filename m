From: Theodore Ts'o <tytso@mit.edu>

The old description for this configuration option was perhaps not
completely balanced in terms of describing the tradeoffs of using a
default of data=writeback vs. data=ordered.  Despite the fact that old
description very strongly recomended disabling this feature, all of
the major distributions have elected to preserve the existing 'legacy'
default, which is a strong hint that it perhaps wasn't telling the
whole story.

This revised description has been vetted by a number of ext3
developers as being better at informing the user about the tradeoffs
of enabling or disabling this configuration feature.

-	  If a filesystem does not explicitly specify a data ordering
-	  mode, and the journal capability allowed it, ext3 used to
-	  historically default to 'data=ordered'.
-
-	  That was a rather unfortunate choice, because it leads to all
-	  kinds of latency problems, and the 'data=writeback' mode is more
-	  appropriate these days.
-
-	  You should probably always answer 'n' here, and if you really
-	  want to use 'data=ordered' mode, set it in the filesystem itself
-	  with 'tune2fs -o journal_data_ordered'.
-
-	  But if you really want to enable the legacy default, you can do
-	  so by answering 'y' to this question.
+	  The journal mode options for ext3 have different tradeoffs
+	  between when data is guaranteed to be on disk and
+	  performance.	The use of "data=writeback" can cause
+	  unwritten data to appear in files after an system crash or
+	  power failure, which can be a security issue.	 However,
+	  "data=ordered" mode can also result in major performance
+	  problems, including seconds-long delays before an fsync()
+	  call returns.	 For details, see:
+
+	  http://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext3_data_mode_tradeoffs
+
+	  If you have been historically happy with ext3's performance,
+	  data=ordered mode will be a safe choice and you should
+	  answer 'y' here.  If you understand the reliability and data
+	  privacy issues of data=writeback and are willing to make
+	  that trade off, answer 'n'.
