Hi Simon,

There are some kernel bits (like iommu initialization patch), which need to
take special action if they are booting after a kexec on panic (Generally we
are referring it to booting into kdump kernel) and that's why the notion
is_kdump_kernel().

To me, is_kdump_kernel() symbolizes whether I  am booting after kexec on
panic and not just the fact if CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP is enabled or not in this
kernel.

So I would think that lets not rename it to kernel_has_vmcore(), instead
lets write few lines of comments before function is_kdump_kernel() to
clarify its meaning.

Secondly, we are using elfcorehdr_addr to determine whether this kernel
is booting after a panic so elfcorehdr_addr is not just limited to
CONFIG_PROC_VMCORE now and we should probably pull it out of
fs/proc/vmcore.c. How about declaring and initializing this variable in
kernel/kexec.c under CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP and always parse elfcorehdr_addr
irrespective of the setting of CONFIG_PROC_VMCORE?

Argument was people can use /dev/oldmem and not use /proc/vmcore. So far
I don't know anybody who uses /dev/oldmem to capture dump and not
/proc/vmcore.
