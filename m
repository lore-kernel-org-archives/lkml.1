Yes, I suggest that, even if barrier=0 remains the default.  I suggest
showing barrier=1 no matter what the default, too, since if the
default is changed, no option will become ambiguous in bug reports,
cut and pastes etc.

Speaking of failed barrier I/O, it should be possible to fall back to
"disable cache, write commit block, enable cache" on old drives which
don't have the cache flush command.

I've no idea.  It makes sense: disabling write cache increases the
number of seeks for many loads.

In any case, with barriers implemented properly you get basically the
same level of integrity as disabling the write cache, without the
substantial performance hit.
