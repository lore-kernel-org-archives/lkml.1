And another thing you could do (best if you support journalling)  
would be to do the allocation and hang the details off the inode on a  
"preallocation list" of some kind and then as the data gets written  
use blocks from the preallocation list as you go along.  This would  
avoid the fragmentation issue for example.  You could then free the  
surplus blocks when the whole range of the file being covered by the  
preallocation list has been written to and/or when the file is closed  
for the last time (drop_inode/delete_inode).
