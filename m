  Ah, OK. The problem manifests itself as an error in SATA communication
(which in fact somehow happens over USB, but I don't really know the
details of mass storage over USB) so debugging USB would become actual only
if we found out it's really some bug in an usb stack. But so far the most
probable is just an error somewhere between the USB controller in the
enclosure and the drive itself. BTW: Is the data transferred over USB
checksummed?
