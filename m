Ok, I would class that as the equivalent of 'changing the hardware'.

I would definantly be interested in hearing some of them. Greg's comment 
makes it sound like this is something that (with modern hardware) could 
happen to anyone at any time (which, if true, would be sufficiant to 
require 'best effort' nameing of devices for everything), while my 
experiance is that if the hardware is static (i.e. you don't plugin or 
unplug PCI devices) the numbering of exisitng PCI devices and buses is 
static. and while I understand that consumer distros want to have 
everything 'best effort' named to make it easier for users, I disagree 
that this should force everyone to use 'best effort' when there are many 
situations where it's unnessasary overhead and chances for errors.
