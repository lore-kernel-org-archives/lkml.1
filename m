I believe GUID Partition Tables (GPTs) are the answer.

I believe one of the features of GPT is the elimination of the 32-bit
sector restrictions.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table

Windows VISTA 64-bit supports GPTs on data disks and new Mac OS based
systems have been using it on internal drives for a couple years at
least.

GPTs are part of the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI), so they
should be usable for PC bootable disks at some point.  (Maybe now in
some cases?)

I'm not sure what the Linux Kernel support is for GPTs.
