There is no problem with the current code on normal desktop boxes with sata
drives.  This optimization is fantastic and greatly increases throughput.  The
problem is that in the case of low latency drives where sleeping for 1 jiffie
(depending on HZ) is entirely too long based on the latency of the disk.  I had
thought about doing the number of syncing threads per transaction, but I'm
worried about the normal case of a running box, ie where the only thing running
fsync is syslog.  In that case the "average fsyncing threads" count would be 1,
so when syslog ran fsync we'd bypass the sleep and just commit, which would
result in utter crap performance from the current code.  Measuring the time it
takes to commit a transaction was a nice uniform way to figure out how long we
may need to wait in order for a usefull amount of stuff to be added to the
transaction, and it would be self tuning to the underlying disk.  The goal was
to maintain the awesome performance we currently get with high latency devices
while at the same time fixing the crappy performance we see with low latency
disks.  I hope that helps.  Thanks,

Josef
