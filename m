Good! You proved that:

1. SCST is capable to work much better than STGT: 35% for md and 37% for 
crypt considering maximum values.

2. Default read-ahead size isn't appropriate for remote data access 
cases and should be increased. I slowly have been discussing it in past 
few months with Wu Fengguang, the read-ahead maintainer.

Which IO scheduler on the target did you use? I guess, deadline? If so, 
you should try with CFQ as well.

Thanks,
Vlad
