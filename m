Clean up: refresh the help text for Kconfig items related to the NFS
client.  Remove obsolete URLs, and make the language consistent among
the options.

Also move the ROOT_NFS config option next to the options related to the
NFS client.

-	  If you are connected to some other (usually local) Unix computer
-	  (using SLIP, PLIP, PPP or Ethernet) and want to mount files residing

-	  protocol, say Y. "Mounting files" means that the client can access
-	  the files with usual UNIX commands as if they were sitting on the
-	  client's hard disk. For this to work, the server must run the
-	  programs nfsd and mountd (but does not need to have NFS file system
-	  support enabled in its kernel). NFS is explained in the Network
-	  Administrator's Guide, available from
-	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#guide>, on its man page: "man

+	  Choose Y here if you want to access files residing on other

-	  A superior but less widely used alternative to NFS is provided by
-	  the Coda file system; see "Coda file system support" below.

-	  Implement the NFSv3 ACL protocol extension for manipulating POSIX

-	  the NFSv3 ACL protocol extension; see the CONFIG_NFSD_V3_ACL option.
+	  Some NFS servers support an auxiliary NFSv3 ACL protocol that
+	  Sun added to Solaris but never became an official part of the
+	  NFS version 3 protocol.  This protocol extension allows
+	  applications on NFS clients to manipulate POSIX Access Control
+	  Lists on files residing on NFS servers.  NFS servers enforce
+	  ACLs on local files whether this protocol is available or not.
+
+	  Choose Y here if your NFS server supports the Solaris NFSv3 ACL
+	  protocol extension and you want your NFS client to allow
+	  applications to access and modify ACLs on files on the server.
+
+	  Most NFS servers don't support the Solaris NFSv3 ACL protocol
+	  extension.  You can choose N here or specify the "noacl" mount
