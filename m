So qc->extra_len == 0 and nothing is done in that case.

I don't understand? Drivers can still do that. Do you mean That it wants
to also complete the draining portion in smaller chunks? I thought the draining
is always done at once, at most. Is that theoretical or is it so in any of the 
drivers.

Any way Nack from my side on the scsi_finish_command(), it makes too many 
assumptions that are unchecked anywhere. And it's a terrible layering violation.
scsi is a pass-threw block device, the fix should be in block or in using device
drivers (eg libata), that know what is going on.

Any way you are always saying req->data_len == sum(sg) but that  was certainly
never true for scsi_bufflen() == sum(sg) so leave that alone please.

Any other block layer fixes are welcome. But for now this is the best fix we have
that only breaks theoretical, yet to be submitted drivers.
