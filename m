Absolutely.

Agreed.

Yes, it should be a void function.

Ouch. Good catch.

Definitely better.

The function is gone. If it gets resurrected, we'll just have to deal with it.

Yes.

True.

And I'll be one of the complainers. Still, the one sure way to stop kernel
growth is to stop adding functionality and stop fixing bugs. I console
myself wth the observation Michael Opdenacker made at this year's
System Size BOF at this year's ELC: system size is growing at a slower rate
than Moore's Law. So, even though the kernel grows each year, the memory it
uses gets cheaper and cheaper.

Thanks for your comments!
