It already is ... as I asked in the actual bug (but no-one seems to have
noticed, so I assume the bug entry isn't set up correctly).  Does this
still persist with 2.6.26-rc5?  The reason for asking is that it looks
very much like a silent manifestation of our scsi_bus_uevent() problem
that got fixed in 2.6.26-rc5.
