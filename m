Basically it appears I am hammering the southbridge as for this board the 
PCI-e (x1) slots also traverse through the southbridge.

  6_SATA -> G965 ICH8
3_PCI-e -> G965 ICH8

northbridge.

If one utilized a 12, 16 or 24 port raid card (but used SW RAID) on the 
x16 slot on the northbridge itself, would this barrier exist as the:
GMCH<->CPU is (8.5GB/s)..?

Also on the X38 and X48 the speed increases slightly:
http://www.intel.com/products/chipsets/X38/X38_Block_Diagram.jpg (10.6GB/s)
http://www.intel.com/products/chipsets/x48/x48_block_diagram.jpg (12.8GB/s)

If one asks why would one need such speed?

Example:
LTO-4 drives can write at 120 MiB/s each:

It is then therefore imperative one could sustain this rate to possibly 
multiple(!) tape drives on a single system.
