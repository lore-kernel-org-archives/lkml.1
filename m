  Yeah, I knew about ext4 doing this. Thanks for pointing this out. I
wanted to trigger a separate discussion about this and similar problems -
the current state of buffer bits is quite messy (I think Ted complained
about this as well recently) and we should somehow clean it up.
  In this particular case: What's the point in returning the buffer mapped?
It does not make any sence logically (block *does not* have any physical
location assigned) and technically you have to map it to some fake block
and later remap it correctly when you do block allocation. So maybe I'm
missing some good reason but from what I can see, it just does not make
sence...
