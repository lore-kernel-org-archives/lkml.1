Indeed.  Also, the issue is not with /how/ SCSI_WAIT_SCAN is switched
on, it is perhaps with /that/ SCSI_WAIT_SCAN is switched on.

SCSI_WAIT_SCAN is a Kconfig variable which does not have a prompt ---
like a large number of other Kconfig variables.  Like most of these
other hidden Kconfig variables, SCSI_WAIT_SCAN controls a very compact
part of kernel functionality.  Its only difference to most if not all of
these variables is that it is a tristate variable which controls
building of a .ko.

And it will keep coming up because the reasons for these choices
(default to m instead of n, no prompt) are not at all obvious.  Perhaps
you should add a comment to drivers/scsi/Kconfig.

Actually while I superficially searched the archive right now I did not
find the reason for not prompting for this variable, other than "it
doesn't hurt to build this module".  Could be that there is an
assumption that people who want the wait scan module in their initrd
were unable to find a respective Kconfig prompt.
