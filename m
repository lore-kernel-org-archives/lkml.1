Then just pass the "name" of the block device into a configfs file,
nothing more is needed, right?

No, you can't do a symlink across superblocks and expect it to work like
you are thinking internally.

No, just because configfs looks like sysfs internally, does not mean
they are related in any manner.  We have been down this argument many
times in the past, please don't bring it up again, it has no bearing on
this at all.
