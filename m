Just as a suggestion, what about adding the component name the same
way we added the priority level --- i.e., by adding an optional
prefix, say "{COMPONENT}" to the printk string, which would be before
the urgency level marker.  If it's not present, printk can generate a
64-bit hash; if it is present, printk can generate the component name
followed by a 32-bit hash.

That way we can gradually add component names in a completely
backwards compatible way, and only to the device drivers that care or
want it.

I would think keeping the kmsg comments as kernel-doc style in the
kernel source file makes a huge amount of sense.
