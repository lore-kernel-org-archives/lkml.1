Ok. Sounds good. Let say for this discussion, container-inits set
SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE_CINIT, global inits continue to set SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE.

Yes, but after Bastian mentioned it recently, I was wondering if we can
keep "SigIgn:" honest by tweaking procfs code - i.e have procfs check
the SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE flags and include SIG_DFL exit signals in the
SigIgn: line.

We could include blocked SIG_DFL signals in the SigIgn: line ? Hacky ?

So if SIGKILL or SIGSTOP are sent from inside the container, we drop them
in prepare_signal() if SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE flags are set. If sent from outside
the container, we queue them and get_signal_to_deliver() delivers these
unless SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE is set (i.e the signals are delivered to cinits but
ignored for global init).

Yes. One thing I am not clear on yet is how we decide in prepare_signal()
if it is safe to check the sender's namespace (since caller of send_signal()
could be an interrupt handler or workqueue).

As I was discussing with Bastian Blank, SI_FROMUSER() is not sufficient
since SI_ASYNCIO appears as an user-space signal.

Now is SI_ASYNCIO really supposed to be a user signal ? Or like SI_MESGQ
and SI_POLL can it be a kernel signal ? If we fix SI_ASYNCIO, can we
safely use SI_FROMUSER() for this  or could there be other 'user' signals
from kernel ?

Yes, that makes a lot of sense to push that initialization to the callers.
We have been going through and identifying the 'si_pid's that need to be fixed.

Yes, its probably moot with the other approach, but the only drawback with
relying on the "->si_pid > 0" check in get_signal_to_deliver() was that
allocation of siginfo_t could have failed. In which case it would be
unclear whether signal was from parent or same namespace.

But if we fix si_pid problems and correctly pass in siginfo_t, can we
use "si_pid > 0" check in prepare_signal() to decide whether or not
to queue the signal ?
