Hi Ted,

I just finished adding the ext4 tracing feature to LTTng. It's in LTTng
0.75 as I write this. The only requirement currently not fulfilled is
the "filtering by dev == 'dm-8'", which I plan to implement later. We
currently have the whole stream of ext4 operations recorded to trace
buffers (all on) when tracing is enabled.

The starting point for the LTTng project is http://ltt.polymtl.ca

You will need LTTng 0.75 and the matching ltt-control and lttv packages
to get this running. Matching versions are listed here :
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/svn/trunk/lttv/doc/developer/lttng-lttv-compatibility.html

To save you time, here are the direct links to the sources :
LTTng :
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/lttng/patch-2.6.28-lttng-0.75.tar.bz2
or
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/compudj/linux-2.6-lttng.git

ltt-control :
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/lttng/ltt-control-0.63-03012009.tar.gz

lttv :
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/packages/lttv-0.12.5-09012009.tar.gz

Follow the QUICKSTART GUIDE to perform the installation :
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/svn/trunk/lttv/QUICKSTART

Once you are setted up, reboot your LTTng-enabled kernel, and try the
following (as root) :

ltt-armall
  (you should see all the markers within lttng probes being enabled on
  the screen. This should include lines beginning with
  "Connecting ext4 ....". If not, make sure you have the lttng ext4
  probe module loaded.)
lttctl -C -w /tmp/trace trace

  (perform some ext4 operations)

lttctl -D trace

lttv -m textDump -e channel.name=ext4 -t /tmp/trace
  This will show events from the ext4 channel only, e.g. :

ext4.da_write_begin: 197.030265213 (/tmp/trace/ext4_3), 4190, 4190, \
    /bin/cp, , 4021, 0x0, SYSCALL \
    { dev = "loop0", ino = 15, pos = 5320704, len = 4096, flags = 0 }
ext4.da_write_end: 197.030268714 (/tmp/trace/ext4_3), 4190, 4190, \
    /bin/cp, , 4021, 0x0, SYSCALL \
    { dev = "loop0", ino = 15, pos = 5320704, len = 4096, copied = 4096 }
ext4.da_write_begin: 197.030279441 (/tmp/trace/ext4_3), 4190, 4190, \
    /bin/cp, , 4021, 0x0, SYSCALL \
    { dev = "loop0", ino = 15, pos = 5324800, len = 4096, flags = 0 }
....

You can also try the GUI interface if you like, with :
lttv-gui -t /tmp/trace

You will find it useful if you need to dig in the ext4 trace information
along with the instrumentation collected from the rest of the kernel.

This is a very basic HOWTO. Don't hesitate to ask if you need help to
tune the amount of events logged (e.g. by disabling some markers, which
can be done by doing a custom ltt-armall script).

Also, lttv filtering currently does not support filtering by event
fields. A quick hack to do it is :

lttv -m textDump -e channel.name=ext4 -t /tmp/trace |grep "dev = \"loop0\","

Enjoy :)

Mathieu
