these are being addressed by suka patches, and also you with the latest patch 
you sent. right ?

a lot of work has been done on that part. take a look at it. the clean up 
is really impressive ! 

NFS still uses the kernel_thread() API. the first thing to do on the kthread
topic is to improve the kthread API.
 
I think we can discard the remaining drivers for the moment.

yes probably. this needs to be sorted out. it makes a container init
process different from the system init process.

see commit b488893a390edfe027bae7a46e9af8083e740668 which is covering 
UNIX socket credentials and more. Are you thinking we should do more for 
credentials and use a struct pid* ? This looks scary.

autofs* is fixed. netlink ?

well, __pgrp and __session are pretty well covered with the __deprecated
attribute. I don't see what else we could to do on these. we can't remove 
the task_{session,pgrp}_* routines. 

we could apply the same __deprecated technique to task->pid, task->tgid.
This is going to be a challenge :)

The kernel will be protected by a CONFIG_NAMESPACES option as soon as it
gets in. Unfortunately, it didn't make 2.6.24 so this will be 2.6.25 
material.
