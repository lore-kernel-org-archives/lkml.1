A checkpointing failure is a bit special.  If the journal is aborted
by journal_commit_transaction(), the integrity of the filesystem is
ensured although the latest changes will be lost.  However, if the
journal is aborted by log_do_checkpoint() and the replay also failed,
the filesystem may be corrupted because some of the metadata blocks
are in old states.  In this case, the user will have to recover the
filesystem manually and carefully.  So I think printing the special
message is needed to inform users about that.

I can understand your concern as the current JBD updates the journal
super block even if a checkpoint has failed.  I think it will be
improved by adding a comment to journal_update_superblock().
For example: don't invoke this function if checkpointing has
failed, otherwise unwritten-back journaled data can be lost.

Or we may stop both modifying j_tail and updating the super block
when the journal has aborted (especially for a reason of checkpoint
failure).  Of course, __journal_abort_soft() still updates the
super block once.
