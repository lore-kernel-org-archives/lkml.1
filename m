 The effect  is  defintely  depending on  the  IO  hardware. I performed the same tests
on a different box with an AACRAID controller and there things look different. Basically
the "offending" commit helps seingle stream performance on that box, while dual/triple
stream are not affected. So I suspect that the CCISS is just not behaving well.

 And yes, the tests are usually done on a freshly booted box. Of course, I repeat them
a few times. On the CCISS box the numbers are very constant. On the AACRAID box
they vary quite a bit.

 I can certainly stress the box before doing the tests. Please define "many" for the kernel
compiles :-)

 I think this late in the 2.6.24 game we just should leave things as they are. But
we should try to find a way to make CCISS faster, as it apparently can be faster.

 Will do.
