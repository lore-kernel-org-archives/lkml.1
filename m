This is also failing on CONFIG_SLUB on 2.6.24 ppc64.  Since the rest of
the system seems to work fine, my only guess it may be related to the
fact that the module is being compiled out of tree.  I took a quick
glance at what kbuild was using for compiler and linker parameters, but
nothing looked out of the ordinary.

I will take a look with kdb and SLUB re-enabled on x86_64 and see if this
helps shed any light on the issue.  Is anyone else seeing an issue with CONFIG_SLUB..?

Also, I wonder who else aside from Ubuntu is using this by default in
their .config..?
