The best possible scenario is .24-rc1 merge window with or without
waiting.  With waiting, the best possible scenario is harder to achieve tho.

You can turn on and off dynamically using a module parameter.  Although
it's not a pretty interface, it should work as an interim solution if we
absolutely must merge ALPM now.

I see.  I get that one way is better than another in some way.  I'm just
not convinced whether the advantage is substantial enough to justify the
complexity.

Having short cool-down time would remove most of performance degradation
and I'm pretty sure power consumption would stay about the same.

Note that PARTIAL also incurs noticeable performance degradation.

I would agree with you, merge it and see the fireworks in -mm if it
didn't involve user visible API.  We have an API decision to make here
and it hasn't been sufficiently considered yet.

As I wrote before, which level of interface to export to userland is
related with where to put the knowledge about working and broken
combinations.  Unfortunately, we don't have data to support one way or
the other at the moment.  All I'm saying is that we should be cautious
before introducing user-land visible interface which lives in SCSI sysfs
as it's unknown whether it would fit the reality or not.

Sorry that I don't have an alternative patch now, but something which
can relieve the situation is being worked on, so let's give it some time
and see how things turn out.  Things have to wait till the next -rc1
window anyway.

Thanks.
