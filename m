Hmm you're right, I was thinking we did some other stuff before put_super which
would have caught a journal abort but it looks like thats not the case.  Still
shouldn't do is_checkpoint_aborted(sbi->s_journal) since journal_destroy()
kfree's the journal.  Should probably move the is_journal_aborted() check above
that or something.  Thanks,
