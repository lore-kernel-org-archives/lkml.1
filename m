OK, I thought I had a test case for this, but when I revert this commit
on git head (and fix up the one reject which just leaves the sr_
function in place) I still produce the same behaviour.

What I'm trying is 

sg_start -i -l <cdrom>

to close the tray followed by your cdparanoia command

Could you see if reverting this commit on git head works for you (in
which case I'm not reproducing it correctly)?

Thanks,

James
