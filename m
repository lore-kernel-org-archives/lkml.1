Hm.  I bought a 500GB drive last year:

sd 1:0:0:0: [sda] 976773168 512-byte hardware sectors (500108 MB)

512 * 976773168
500107862016

512 * 976773168 / (1024 * 1024 * 1024)
465.76174163818359375000

If we report it as 465GB, we will get questions.  Even pretending it's
1024 * 1000 * 1000 doesn't work:

512 * 976773168 / (1000 * 1000 * 1024)
488.38658400000000000000

I think we have to stick with dividing by multiples of 1000.  It's what
the drive manufacturers do (and I do understand their reasons for doing
it).

Yes.

Reasonable minds can certainly disagree on this one.  I respectfully
submit that reporting a 97415MB capacity is less useful than reporting a
97GB capacity.  If you look at drive advertisements, they sell 1TB,
1.5TB, 80GB, 750GB, 360GB, ... we should be trying to match that.  I'm a
little dubious about trying to match the 1.5TB; I think 1500GB is close
enough, but a 50GB drive shouldn't be reported as 50000MB.  IMO, anyway.

I understand why networking tools are particularly cautious about this.
The line rate (eg 1Gbps) is 1000,000,000 bps, but the amount of traffic
reported might well use either binary SI or decimal SI.  Reporting the
wrong one makes a 7% difference at the GB/GiB level, and that's the kind
of amount that people can spend a week or more chasing.

I think it'll be a while before we get drives of that capacity.  ATA is
limited to 48 bits for the number of sectors, and while you can increase
the sector size (4k is currently planned), that still doesn't bring you
close.  I suppose you could get ata_ram to have multiple drives and
raid-0 them together, but you'd still need to allocate 2^13 of them.

scsi_debug can probably go to the full 2^64 sectors.  I haven't looked
into it.

That sounds odd to me; what command are you using to rebuild?
