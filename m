That's not really an adequate admonishment because it didn't go to the
list I'm looking at these on, so it's hard to find but more importantly
anyone doing a git log through our sources at a later time will be
incredibly hard pressed to find it either.  the 0/X is supposed to be a
preamble, not a substitute for patch descriptions.  If you plan on
rolling all these patches up with the 0/19 as the description, that's
fine, but I'd have still liked to see the description accompanying the
patch to the list you sent it to.

If this applied to all driver files, I might buy it.  However, if you
have to match on subvendor/subdevice, you have to write out the whole
thing anyway.  PCI_VDEVICE() doesn't even give us the scope to expand
struct pci_device_id because it doesn't (and can't in its current form)
initialise the fields by name.

I'm having trouble seeing the actual value of a macro at all.  As I said
above, it doesn't seem to be an improvement over the bare initialiser
values.  It seems principally designed to save driver writers from
typing ... which is fine, but not really if you apply it after the fact.
It also doesn't seem to have the hallmarks of a true standardisation
because of all the exceptions.  All it really does do is deprecate the
bare use of PCI_ANY_ID ... but is that worth all the code churn?
