I'm told that the ADMA hardware does have some support for issuing ATAPI 
commands, however according to Allen Martin of NVIDIA, "The ATAPI 
support in the ADMA hardware had some serious problem that forced us to 
turn it off in the Windows driver." So it looks like ATAPI in ADMA mode 
is likely a non-starter.
