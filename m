Thanks Benny, it would be nice to connect all these thing together.

If at all then it's avishayfs, but unless I write this filesystem from
scratch I don't think I can do anything about the name. The code is
copyrighted to Avishay Traeger, and that is the name he chose. Also
he has a sourceforge.net project of that name for a long time.

Avishay would you be willing to change the name? See above, people
think it is too generic a name. Like if someone would do a scsifs
or blocksfs.

Personally for me it's just a name, I don't mind either way.

I've been working on this OSD stuff for a while now, and I'm very excited 
about it, it feels very powerful yet simple. I was able to reach
stable results (hopefully) in relatively short time. and the code size of
both the Initiator and the osdfs is pretty small.

I forgot to mention in my introduction that I was able to clone
a git tree over an osdfs mount, compile a kernel, which actually
runs. Make changes git-diff and commit the changes. Unmount/mount
and diff with original tree with success. So it is functional.
With Benny's stuff it might even get fast with the right setup.
