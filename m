Unfortunately, behaviour is different for different filesystems. I
can only answer for XFS, which is different to most of the other
filesystems in both locking and the way it treats the page cache.
IOWs, if you want to talk about details, then have to talk about
specific implementations because.....

"all" is avoidable, too, once you've kicked the pages out of
the page cache - you just have to block the buffered read triggered
by refaulting the page will cause until the direct I/O completes.

Only if we leave the page in the page cache. If we toss the page,
the time it takes to do the I/O for the page fault is enough for
the direct I/o to complete. Sure it's not an absolute guarantee,
but if you want an absolute guarantee:

As I said earlier.....
