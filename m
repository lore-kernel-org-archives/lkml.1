I've always agreed with "be safe first" and have worked where
we always shut write cache off unless we knew it had battery.

But before we make disabling cache the default, this is the impact:

- users will see it as a performance regression

- trashy OS vendors who never disable cache will benchmark
   better than "out of the box" linux.

Because as we all know, users don't read release notes.

Been there, done that, felt the pain.
