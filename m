Not really. The only resemblance we have to a SCSI controller is the fact that we hang SCSI, SAS, and SATA drives off the backend. Our implementation of the SCSI spec is cherry picked for what we need. That, of course, could be changed.

We already handle tape drives quite easily and one of these days I hope to satisfy Andrew to the point where he will accept my sysfs changes.

Precisely why I am luke warm to this proposal. Who's going to help customers decide which driver to use? What if a number of customers are happy with the block driver? Who will decide for them when to switch? What if a customer is using the block driver and unknowingly upgrades to the SCSI driver? He's dead the water at best, lost his data at worst.

Have you taken into consideration any of the HP utilities and management agents? Those must work, period.

We already have a SCSI port of the driver that is at least as functional as you decribe. But I am against it's release for the reasons stated above. If we ever decide to release the SCSI port it should be developed by HP so we can be assured that the utils and agents work as expected. That doesn't mean we wouldn't leverage some of your work. ;)

If cciss is ever released as a SCSI driver it would be best if the work was done at HP. Thank you for your efforts, Tomo. I hope you understand my position.
