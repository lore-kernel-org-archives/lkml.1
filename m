on the other hand, I have two systems in my lab with identical hardware, 
loaded with the same OS image, but one calls the interfaces eth0, eth1, 
eth2 while the other calls them eth12, eth13, eth14 becouse it had three 
quad cards installed in it for a few days several months ago.

also think what happens to a system if you replace a failed NIC with an 
card identical except the MAC addresses. instead of everything just 
working as before, you now have new ethX devices and are missing the old 
ethX devices.

both ways of doing things can yield nonsense results in cases where the 
other one gives perfectly useable results.

nobody is arguing that the ability to nail things down by MAC address 
(or drives by UUID) should be removed, we're just arguing that the option 
to get useable consistant names from hardware that is consistant is being 
removed and that it shouldn't be, it has it's place just like the 'best 
effort' naming.
