Someone on the XFs list had an interesting request - preallocated
swap files. You can't use unwritten extents for this because
of sys_swapon()s use of bmap() (XFS returns holes for reading
unwritten extents), so we need a method of preallocating that does
not zero or mark the extent unread. i.e. FA_MKSWAP.

I thinkthis would be:

#define FA_FL_NO_ZERO_SPACE	0x08	/* default is to zero space */

#define FA_MKSWAP 	(FA_ALLOCATE | FA_FL_NO_ZERO_SPACE)

That way we can allocate large swap files that don't need zeroing
in a single, fast operation, and hence potentially bring new
swap space online without needed very much memory at all (i.e.
should succeed in most near-OOM conditions).

Cheers,

Dave.
