Hmmm, I did not replace any KERN_ERR by ext3_warning / KERN_WARNING, but
made those KERN_ERR calls more verbose. Does that change anything ?

For the record, I wanted to replace KERN_ERR calls by calls to a wrapper
much like ext3_warning (but obviously calling KERN_ERR), later on.

Ack, not pretty. Will fix that in next version.

OK, will do. Thanks for the suggestion.

Then this (old) coding style is not consistent within super.c , and not 
consistent with the example given in Documentation/CodingStyle either.
I will "fix" the indentation in a separate patch for the whole file, to
be merged or not.

OK. I did ext3/ext4 at once because of what Andrew replied to Kasper :
"We like to keep ext3 and ext4 in sync as much as poss, please."
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/6/9/79
But I can do ext3 first and then back / forward port to ext2 and ext4 as
well, as you suggest.

Thank you very much for replying.

Best,

Francois
