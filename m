Now that the iproute2 patch is upstream, this patchset really is the
only thing keeping us from using network namespaces.  Given that the
details of the tagging are trivially changeable with no abi changes, I'd
personally much rather see the patches go in as is, with whatever new
tagging patches Benjamin whips up, using ida or some new idea, being
applied later if we feel the need.
