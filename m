Please cpoy linux-ext4 on ext2/3/4 material.

I skippped a lot of these patches because I just got bored of fixing
rejects.  Now is a very optimistic time to be raising patches against
mainline.

I'm going to work on getting a unified devel tree operating: one which
contains everyone's latest stuff and is updated daily.  Basically it'll be
-mm without a couple of the quilt trees.  People can then prepare patches
against that, as it seems that most can't be bothered patching against -mm,
let alone building and testing it.  More later.

The ext3_ioctl() caller has an open fd against the fs - should be
sufficient to keep unmount away?

(gets even more rejects, drops all the fasync patches too)

It's all reached the stage of stupid.
