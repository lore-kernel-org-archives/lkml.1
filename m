Well 2TB, assuming a 4k blocksize, means a block bitmap is 512 megs.
So at least for ext3, 4GB should be just enough, unless you hit
certainly really nasty complicated corruptions (i.e. large number of
blocks claimed by more than one inode, which can happen if an inode
table is written to the wrong location on disk --- on top of some
other portion of the inode table), or if the filesystem has a large
number of files with hard links (such as the case with certain backup
programs).

The plan is to implement some kind of run-length encoding to compress
the in-memory requirements for storing the bitmaps, but that hasn't
been coded yet.  If someone is a staff programmer for one of these
bookshelf NAS manufacturers is interested in implementing such a
beast, they should talk to me; I've thought quite a bit about the
design, and I just need a minion to implement it.  :-)

And ext4 extents will help because it reduces the number of indirect
blocks you have to read, which will significantly reduce the fsck
time.  So there will be improvements on the horizon.
