Hi Linus,

Please include the following patch.

This is an important fix posted by Christoph Hellwig today.
Without this fix, XFS can turn off barriers when we wrap our ondisk log.
Which could lead to corruption after unclean unmounts/shutdowns
on machines without a persistent write cache etc.

---------------
Fix barrier fail detection in XFS

Currently we disable barriers as soon as we get a buffer in xlog_iodone
that has the XBF_ORDERED flag cleared.  But this can be the case not only
for buffers where the barrier failed, but also the first buffer of a
split log write in case of a log wraparound.  Due to the disabled
barriers we can easily get directory corruption on unclean shutdowns.
So instead of using this check add a new buffer flag for failed barrier
writes.

This is a regression vs 2.6.26 caused by patch to use the right macro
to check for the ORDERED flag, as we previously got true returned for
every buffer.

Thanks to Toei Rei for reporting the bug.
