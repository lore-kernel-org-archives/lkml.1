Function declarations are often larger than 80 characters. And if you wrap 
them at 100, you are wasting every second line on 80-character display.

If you make line length unlimited, the space will be used optimally on all 
displays --- a function with 200 character declaration will use 3 lines on 
80-character display and 2 lines on 100-character display.

And besides --- wrapping at 100 doesn't fix the initial problem (why I 
posted this thread) --- that making any modification to the function 
header or long expression requires the user to manually realign the 
arguments.
