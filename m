Thank you for your reply.

What we are noticing is invalidate_inode_pages2_range() fails with -EIO
(from try_to_free_buffers() since b_count > 0).

I don't think the file is being updated through mmap(). Previous
writepage() added these buffers to t_sync_data list (data=ordered).
filemap_write_and_wait() waits for pagewrite back to be cleared.
So, buffers are no longer dirty, but still on the t_sync_data and
kjournald didn't get chance to process them yet :(

Since we have elevated b_count on these buffers, try_to_free_buffers()
fails. How can we make filemap_write_and_wait() to wait for kjournald
to unfile these buffers ?

Does this makes sense ? Am I missing something here ?

Thanks,
Badari
