I disagree. The difference between advertised and actual capacity is 
only going to get worse when drive capacity increases further.
e.g. "4TB" will only be 3.6TB.

Who is going to be asking these questions about the kernel output, but 
not about whatever else reports 465GB, from 'df' to a GUI showing disk 
capacity? This actually makes the kernel more consistent with everything 
else.

This really depends on whether or not you're going for matching advertised 
capacity. I think the extra digit avoids losing precision too early.

If you're intending to divide by 1000 you may as well determined what the 
advertised capacity would be and handle .5 xB (or even .25, .75, .1 
through .9).

It's not actually a useful value... you'd need to use the byte value, which 
is also displayed, to monitor actual usage over time.

The sector size can't currently be increased beyond 512 to get around this 
because it's scaled to 512 to store capacity. (Which my patch then uses to 
avoid computing the unit splits at runtime.)

Maybe I was imagining it then... it appeared to be doing that at times 
while I found all the possible ways to mess up calculating 100000xB 
and having "0 EB" devices each time.
