RHEL 5.x is not the sole reason for that.

Not too many, There are only two interfaces device-mapper and cgroup.

I think whichever users like, it's up to users.

Both device-mapper and cgroup interfaces are supported continuously.

I don't think that cgroup is not the preferred interface, especially
not if dm-ioband uses with cpu/memory controller together. Once a
dm-ioband device is created, all configurations for the device can be
done through the cgroup interface like other cgroup subsystems. It
does not require a different set of userspace tools/libraries to be
used.

I think it is natural to make dm-ioband can be configured by
device-mapper's interface since dm-ioband is a device-mapper driver,
and it extends use case, rather it limits usefulness.

Thanks,
