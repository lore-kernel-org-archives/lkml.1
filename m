Adding comments explaining this is good, I think.

But not a help text that can never be shown.  Turn this into a comment
and I'll apply the patch.

The reason is the fact that this could be construed as a detectable bug
(option with help that can never be displayed) and someone with too much
time on their hands someday might make a static checker for it.
