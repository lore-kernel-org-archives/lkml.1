So you think the parametrisation in the block layer is the wrong way to
approach the problem?  On this argument your next patch should be
removing physical merging as well because it also relies on a
parametrisation model of how the device builds the sg list.

I'm sorry sparc broke, really I am ... but you changed your iommu code
from one with a working vmerge to one without and failed to turn off
vmerging.  Partly it wasn't noticed because at 2*PAGE_SIZE you have a
strange vmerge boundary, so it's harder to notice.   However, I can't
extrapolate that just because this happened on sparc it will inevitably
happen on all other architectures.

Actually, parisc will test your code we have a PAGE_SIZE vmerge
boundary, so the effect is much more noticeable.

OK ... well you've had your say and so have I.  The code in question is
the responsibility of a particular maintainer ... we'll let him decide.

You're advocating an out of tree patch as a solution?  I didn't know
you'd been appointed RHEL maintainer ;-)
