Hi Matt,

is what you're detecting here really something we're worried about?

Maybe that's something we should be doing - coming up with a list of
the things we are trying to detect or prevent.  I can only think of
a few offhand:

1. checkpoint (and restart) a task which has used a resource which we
do cannot (yet, or ever) safely checkpoint/restart.

2. kernel has a new feature for which we have not considered
checkpoint/restart.  Not only is it not safe to c/r a task using it,
but we haven't even implemented a check for tasks using it.

3. Some new kernel feature has an attribute which simply must be
stored away.  An example would be the vdso_base in s390 as of
recent 2.6.29 rc's, which was not present in 2.6.28.  So there are
two things to worry about in this one:

	a. detect that this happened and handle it, so c/r continues
	   to work.
	b. figure out a way to restart an older c/r image on a newer
	   kernel - or simply detect older images and call them
	   incompatible.
