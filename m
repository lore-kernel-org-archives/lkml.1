Thinking about it, there could be a way to insure limited ZF and %al
liveliness: adding an epilogue to the expected instruction sequence
formed by an asm statement which clobbers the flags (flags are clobbered
in any asm statement on x86) and clobbers %al.

>From that point, we just have to find a specific signature that gcc
could not imitate to put in this asm statement, so we can detect if
other instructions have been placed in the middle of our sequence by
gcc. Actually, I think the best thing to do with this asm statement is
to put the instruction pointer in a special section, so we know that
this code location marks the end of ZF and %al liveliness. There would
be therefore no added code, just asm constraints.

This epilogue should then be used on both branches of the condition,
like this :

if (unlikely(imv_cond(var))) {
  imv_cond_end();
  ...
} else {
  imv_cond_end();
   ...
}

Where imv_cond_end() would look like this :

+/*
+ * Puts a test and branch make sure the %al register and ZF are not live
+ * anymore.
+ * All asm statements clobbers the flags, but add "cc" clobber just to be sure.
+ * Clobbers %al.
+ */
+#define imv_cond_end()                                                 \
+       do {                                                            \
+               asm (".section __imv_cond_end,\"a\",@progbits\n\t"      \
+                               _ASM_PTR "1f\n\t"                       \
+                               ".previous\n\t"                         \
+                               "1:\n\t"                                \
+                               : : : "a", "cc");                       \
+       } while (0)
+

The pattern to test for will therefore become :

mov, test, branch, address following branch should be in the
__imv_cond_end table.
The address of the branch target site would also have to be in the
__imv_cond_end table.

So, if we do is I propose here, we have to take into account this
question too. Any jump that jumps in the middle of this instruction
sequence would have to insure correct liveliness of %al and ZF. However,
since we just limited the scope of their liveliness, there are no other
code paths which can jump in the middle of our instruction sequence and
insure correct ZF and %al liveliness.

Does it make sense ?
