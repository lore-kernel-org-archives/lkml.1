I see.  Then the potential issue I raised would exist.

Right.  It only becomes relevant if something else clears TIF_SINGLE_STEP,
which does not happen now.  I was discussing the scenario of having
user_disable_single_step clear it.  That might happen inside a stop,
i.e. inside do_signal (get_signal_to_deliver).  So given that order of
checks, it becomes possible for user_disable_single_step to affect the
pending-step-should-SIGTRAP situation.

Right.  That means we should leave the status quo of not clearing
TIF_SINGLE_STEP in user_disable_single_step.

Yes, good.

In old (current) ptrace, user_*_single_step is never called on current.
In utrace, it's always called on current, so utrace-based ptrace alone
adds this second reload overhead beyond the same context-switch overhead
old ptrace has.  Indeed that addition may be neglible.

In other circumstances with utrace, it is very possible to wind up with
user_disable_single_step being called superfluously when there was no
stop (and so not necessarily any context switch or other high overhead).
On other machines, user_disable_single_step is pretty cheap even where
user_enable_single_step is quite costly.  Given how simple and cheap it
is to short-circuit the excess work on s390, I think it is worthwhile.

It looks like the context-switch code already checks some magic bits in
per_info to decide whether to do the costly reload.  So it seems vaguely
consistent with that to conditionalize FixPerRegisters similarly.  The
single_step cases are a special case with an easy one-bit check to
short-circuit, so skipping all of FixPerRegisters seems worthwhile IMHO.

To be really optimization-happy about it, you'd also hack FixPerRegisters
itself to do the reload on current only if PSW_MASK_PER is or was set (if
I'm following the code correctly).  Or perhaps it should check PER_EM_MASK
instead to match what __switch_to does.  (I don't understand the
distinction between those two tests, if there is one.)  Extra frobbity
would be to leave the old state too when clearing PSW_MASK_PER, and then
just have the trap handler lazily ignore a hit when current doesn't have
it set.  Then in a case where there is no hit before context switch,
you haven't done anything.  But that is probably both excessive and
not even a win if the PER use is single-step and so there will really
very likely be a hit before context switch.


Thanks,
Roland
