The code is relatively new and I planned it for the merge window for
2.6.29. I still have to nag our performance team to do some tests with
it.

I could have but I noticed at the same time that executable_stack is
unused. If somebody finds a need for the executable_stack argument it
can easily re-added but I can't think of a use for it. Ergo I removed
it.

What has address space layout / randomization to do with
executable_stack? You lost me there.

Thanks. I'll add it.
