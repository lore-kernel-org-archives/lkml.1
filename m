I wouldn't say that this is better:
				int csf_failed, vars_equal, flags_12;

				...

				csf_failed = call_some_function(s, value) != RET_SUCCESS;
				vars_equal = var_1 == prev_var_1 && var_2 == prev_var_2;
				flags_12 = flags & (FLAG_1 | FLAG_2);
				if (unlikely(csf_failed) || vars_equal ||
				    flags_12 || some_other_conditions) {
				}

If you think that it is better, it's OK, just write your code like that. 
And don't force it to everyone.

For me, breaking the expression into variables is worse because:
- adding/removing conditions must be done at 3 places (vs. my original 
example, where it would be done only on 1 place)
- when reading the conditions, your eyes must skip to two places (vs. my 
original example, where you only read it at one place)

But everyone has different brain, so it may be that for you, the extra 
variables are really more understandable. So write your code like that and 
don't preach.
