That isn't true.  Take a look at the dmesg log accompanying Tim's 
usbmon log.  Although there were 5 read errors in the usbmon log, there 
were only 2 I/O error messages in dmesg, corresponding to the 2 reads 
that weren't retried successfully.

Personally, I think it makes little sense to print error messages in 
the system log for commands where retries are disallowed.  Unless we go 
ahead and print error messages for _all_ failures, including those 
which are retried successfully.

Perhaps a good compromise would be to set the REQ_QUIET flag in 
req->cmd_flags for readaheads.  That would suppress the error messages 
coming from the SCSI core.

Actually the retry decisions (or many of them) are made by the SCSI 
core, and that's also where some of those error messages come from.

To clarify, the enclosure isn't really very buggy.  It _should_ have
carried out the failed commands, or if it had a valid reason for not
doing so then it _should_ have reported the reason.  Regardless, the
errors that occurred were harmless because they went away when the
commands were retried.  (Although if they weren't harmless, you
wouldn't be able to tell just from reading the system log...)
