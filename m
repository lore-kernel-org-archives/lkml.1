I think this is pretty much par for the course for IDE drivers ... send
it a bogus taskfile (which root is allowed to do) and you'll see it
exhibit the same behaviour.  I suspect what happened is that the driver
expects to treat all REQ_BLOCK_PC requests as taskfiles, so the
wrappered SCSI command got treated as a task file ... the rest you know.
