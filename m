The current lockd implementation already drops all locks if nfsd goes
down (providing there are no local NFS mounts). The last lockd_down call
will bring down lockd and it will drop all of its locks in the process.
My vote for "yes" is a vote to keep things the way they are. I don't
think I'd consider it disruptive.

Changing lockd to not drop locks will mean that userspace will need to
take extra steps if someone wants to bring down NFS and unmount an
underlying filesystem. Those extra steps could be a SIGKILL to lockd or
a call into the new interfaces your recent patchset adds. Either way,
that would mean a change in behavior that will have to be accounted for
in userspace.
