You are right, on reads I might be screwed.

Yes, you are unfortunately, totally right. As I sent the last patches
(blk_make_request) I realized that current osd code has a bug in that
it does not bounce properly, all of the buffers. Since there is only
iscsi transports, which are byte-aligned, and the network does it's
own highmem bouncing, in practice there is no such bug.

But you are right, not thanks to block policy.

The solution to this, I think, is that the bouncing layer should receive a
residual count, and not bounce anything beyond what's transferred. (On reads,
writes does nothing), and zero-out the rest. This of course means that all
block drivers make sure residual is properly set, the way it should as explained
in this thread. (SCSI does the right thing where it can, for example
see scsi_execute())

Thanks for bringing this up. Another unfortunate item on my todo list.
