I have many backups of data from the late 1990s onward, each of which have=
=20
been combined into tar files and then encrypted with gpg, each is about 4=
=20
gigabytes so I can store them on DVD.  For quicker access, I also kept
them on software raid.  In the past, I have always kept them on either SW=
=20
RAID5 or SW RAID6 using XFS.  All of the machines in question that I=20
have/had the data on never exhibited any bad memory and all pass memtest=20
OK.  However, what is worrisome, is, on occasion, the mismatch_cnt=20
would be some crazy number on different machines, 2000 or 5000, I checked=
=20
all of the disks with smart, they appear to be OK and when I run a check=20
and repair against the raid then the count will usually go back down to=20
zero.

However, in reality, are these "mismatches" really an indication of silent=
=20
data corruption?  In my case, I have 199 of these backup files and when I=
=20
tried to unencrypt the data, I got these errors on several volumes:

This resulted in partial-sized corrupted tarballs, I am decompressing each
of the 199 backups now to isolate which are affected so I can come up with
a better count on how many files were affected.

The total amount of data is:=20
832G in 199 files (4.18gig/file average)

The hdd image seems 'shifted' see the following sequence: (201..f..R..c) on
the first line.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

So the question then becomes where did the shift begin?  Way above we see
the initial error began on xaa (100M) -> xbn (1M)

dvd$ md5sum xbm
2524788769acf2b0f98346f488a58441  xbm
hdd$ md5sum xbm
2524788769acf2b0f98346f488a58441  xbm

So then we want to take an od of xbn and then diff that:

It starts at the following segment:

dvd:

On the linux-raid mailing list, this issue is often discussed:
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-raid@vger.kernel.org/msg07541.html

The solution seems to be repair and keep on trucking along, which is=20
probably fine for a filesystem with hundreds/thousands of files, most=20
likely, you would never notice the corruption.  However, with gpg, the file=
s
obviously cannot suffer any corruption. It is only when I tried to extract =
the=20
data did I notice this problem.

Options/alternatives for maintaining data integrity?

1. Obviously DVD and/or LTO-tape (multiple copies of data at rest)
http://epoka.dk/media/Linear_Tape_Open_(LTO)_Ultrium_Data_Cartridges.pdf
-> For LTO-2/LTO-3
-> Uncorrected bit error rate 1x10-17 1x10-17
-> Undetected bit error rate 1x10-27 1x10-27

2. ZFS, but only runs in user-space in Linux.

3. Keep an md5sum for each file on the filesystem and run daily checks?

Other options?

How do others maintain data integrity?  Just not worry about it until you h=
ave
to, rely on backups.. or?
