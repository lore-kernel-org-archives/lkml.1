Well, debuggers do it, and that's ultimately what why we have debugging 
annotation formats like DWARF2 - to be able to take an arbitrary state 
and decode local variables from the combined register-memory state. 
This is often done by an interpreter, but that's not necessary; a 
compiler can use the debugging information and build appropriate capture 
code, which would be able to execute very quickly.  Not only is this 
capable of extracting arbitrary information, but it also guarantees that 
the extraction code is out of line.

The act of building a stack frame not only preturbs the generated code 
(gcc has to guarantee liveness, which you can see as a pro or a con), 
but it also puts a fair amount of code in the icache path of the function.

Now, if a breakpoint is too expensive, one can do exactly the same trick 
with a naked call instruction, with a higher icache impact in the unused 
case (five bytes instead of one or two).  However, the key to low impact 
is to use the debugging information to recover state.

(Liveness at the probe point is still possible to enforce with this 
technique: give gcc a "g" read constraint as part of the probe 
instruction.  That makes gcc ensure the information is *somewhere*.  The 
debugging information will tell you where to pick it up from. 
Obviously, any time liveness is enforce you suffer a potential cost.)
