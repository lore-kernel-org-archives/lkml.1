I read the whole thread before I found what you were talking about here:

http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=122937424114658&w=2

With this comment:

"When setting foreground and log writer to rt-prio, the log latency reduced to 4.8ms. \
Performance is about 1.5% higher than the CFS result.  
On a side note, we had been using rt-prio on all DBMS processes and log writer ( in \
higher priority) for the best OLTP performance. That has worked pretty well until \
2.6.25 when the new rt scheduler introduced the pull/push task for lower scheduling \
latency for rt-task. That has negative impact on this workload, probably due to the \
more elaborated load calculation/balancing for hundred of foreground rt-prio \
processes. Also, there is that question of no production environment would run DBMS \
with rt-prio. That is why I am going back to explore CFS and see whether I can drop \
rt-prio for good."

A couple of questions:

1) how does the latest rt scheduler compare?  There has been a lot of improvements.
2) how many rt tasks?
3) what were the prios, producer compared to consumers, not actual numbers
4) have you tried pinning tasks?

RT is more about determinism than performance. The old scheduler
migrated rt tasks the same as other tasks. This helps with performance
because it will keep several rt tasks on the same CPU and cache hot even
when a rt task can migrate. This helps performance, but kills
determinism (I was seeing 10 ms wake up times from the next-highest-prio
task on a cpu, even when another CPU was available).

If you pin a task to a cpu, then it skips over the push and pull logic
and will help with performance too.
