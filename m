Hi,

[ I appreciate you forked the thread and gave it a better subject name,
it would be better still if you could maintain the original CC list, thanks. ]

I have to agree with Simon that ...

static int __init wait_scan_init(void)
{
	scsi_complete_async_scans();
	return 0;
/* BTW this could've been return scsi_complete_async_scans();
 * I see scsi_complete_async_scans() never fails, but still. */
}
late_initcall(wait_scan_init);

... does _not_ deserve to be a module, and writing/building a module
for something like this (just to run a function in some kernel subsytem)
does not seem to be the proper way to solve the problem either. And
IMHO sysfs attribute for this is a good (well, better than this module
thing, at least) suggestion -- I hope you'd take it more seriously.

Doesn't really matter, but perhaps who created the sysfs namespace
for scsi in /sys/module/scsi_mod/... could be the best person to suggest.

Merely needs to be a "echo 1 > " kind of attribute. Whenever a
store_ happens on that attribute (and it's "1"), we just call
scsi_complete_async_scans(). Then we reset the attribute itself back
to 0. Also we could introduce a lock on wait_for_async_scans so that
we don't call scsi_complete_async_scans() twice if someone
accidentally "echo 1 > "'s to it more than once (if that would really be
a bad thing, otherwise it's fine). Also, something like ... if you read the
attribute _during_ the scsi_complete_async_scans(), then you get to
see "1".

All this is doesn't really matter, anyway, all that we really care about
is that: scsi_complete_async_scans() should run whenever something
gets written to this attribute, isn't it?

> > >semantics of it (read-only?  read-write?  write-only?

Well, it _has_ to be write, don't really care if it's read-write or
write-only. I would still prefer read-write, but we can go ahead with
write-only too. It doesn't really matter, does it?

> > >blocking?)

Why, blocking, of course. scsi_complete_async_scans() by definition
is supposed to _wait_ for async scans to complete, after all? And I
see a wait_for_completion() in their which means the current method
will also block during insmod time anyway, so we'll only be
maintaining present behaviour.

What do the distro people really care?

It's either going to be a:

modprobe scsi_wait_scan

versus a:

echo 1 > /sys/module/scsi_mod/.../wait_for_async_scans

somewhere in some script. In fact, the latter method seems simpler,
saner, better (in every which way)!

It's not _inconvenient_. Just that writing/building a module for accomplishing
something like that ... is just not _right_.

Yes.

OK, I'll get really silly here myself. I don't want even that half a second of
overhead when that module is being _built_ (during make modules), not
the overhead of copying / installing at modules_install time.

I apologize if I sounded impolite, and I certainly don't want to act
demanding / difficult or anything, but it's just that doing this via a sysfs
attribute (or hey, anything else!) sounds a better way to tackle this than
this module thing. IMHO, at least.
