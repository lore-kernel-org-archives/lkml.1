Excellent.

You make a good point.  There's definitely still work to be done around
error handling.  OTOH, we could always do what IDE does ...

static void idedisk_prepare_flush(struct request_queue *q, struct request *rq)
{
        ide_drive_t *drive = q->queuedata;
        struct ide_cmd *cmd = kmalloc(sizeof(*cmd), GFP_ATOMIC);

        /* FIXME: map struct ide_taskfile on rq->cmd[] */
        BUG_ON(cmd == NULL);
