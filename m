The only current consumer of call_usermodehelper_pipe() is
fs/exec.c::do_coredump() and it appears to manipulate the blob of data
via file-level operations.  Would this be a 'notification'
alternative?  Or, are you suggesting the whole process be redone (both
notification and blob-transfer)?  Uevent notifications with a udev
user-space front-end appears to be a much more simplified and flexible
mechanism.
