Not a "con" at all.

For the usage purposes, kernel_thread() is arch-independent.
Filesystems create kernel threads and not have a single bit of
arch-specific code.

This is by design.

Granularity of whole damn thing is one container both on checkpoint and
restart.

You want to chop pieces, fine, do surgery on _image_.

kernel_thread() is effectively clone(2).

Do this in userspace.

Given correctly written image chopper, all pids will be fine and
correctness will be bounded by how good user understands what can be
chopped and can't.

Besides, if such chopper can only chop task_struct's, you'll get correct
image.

In the end correctness of chopping will be equal to how good user
understands that two task_struct's are independent of each other.

You want to do small part in userspace and consequently end up with hacks
both userspace-visible and in-kernel.

Pids aren't special, they are struct pid, dynamically allocated and
refcounted just like any other structtures.

They _become_ special for you intended method of restart.

You also have flags in nsproxy image (or where?) like "do clone with
CLONE_NEWUTS".

This is unneeded!

nsproxy (or task_struct) image have reference (objref/position) to uts_ns image.

On restart, one lookups object by reference or restore it if needed,
takes refcount and glue. Just like with every other two structures.

No "what to do, what to do" logic.

Regarding of who should orchestrate restart(2).

Special process who calls restart(2) should do it. It doesn't relate to
restarted process at all. It isn't, for example, init of future container.

Reasons:
1) somebody should write registers before final jump to userspace.
   Task itself can't generally do it: struct pt_regs is in the same place
   as kernel stack.

   cr_load_cpu_regs() does exactly this: as current writes to it's own
   pt_regs. Oren, why don't you see crashes?

   I first tried to do it and was greeted with horrible crashes because
   e.g current becoming NULL under current. That's why 
   cr_arch_restore_task_struct() is not done in current context.

2) Somebody should restore who is parent of whom, who ptraces whom,
   resolved all possible loops and so on. Intuition tells me that it
   should be context which is not involved into restart(2) other than
   doing this post-restart-before-thaw part.

   Consequently, it should not be init of futire container. It's just
   another task after all, from the POV of reparenting code.
