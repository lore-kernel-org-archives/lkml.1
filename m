OK.

Except most processes aren't big multi-threaded servers and not everyone
runs such processes. They'll experience the overhead of a global lock
when they don't have to. Again, it's a question of magnitudes we don't
know I think.

Well, I imagine holding tasklist_lock is worse than cgroup_mutex in some
ways since it's used even more widely. Makes sense not to use it here..
