Yep, this would be right. We could actually do more prefaulting; I
think I was being a little over conservative and worried about earlier
pages being unmapped before we were able to consume them... but I
think being too worried about that case is optimizing an unusual case
that is probably performing badly anyway at the expense of more common
patterns.

Anyway, what I was doing to test this code when I wrote it was to
inject random failures into user copy functions. I guess this could
be useful to merge in the error injection framework?

Thanks,
Nick
