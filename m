This was already reported by Alexey Dobriyan and I included his patch in
my Thumb-2 branch (and -next for now):

http://linux-arm.org/git?p=linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=4fb3c2e2ab3549308a1b1663296d165e45d72ba5

Since this macro is only used in ARM assembly code, the patch simply
adds some ifdefs around it.

Russell, if you are OK with Alexey's patch, I'll send you a pull request
(though for only one patch, alternatively just merge it manually).
