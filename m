For the record, I was able to reproduce with a dual core 2.6.26-rc4
x86 client (using SLUB, not SLAB) on Fedora 8 against a Solaris 2008.5
NFSv4 server.  When the client runs out of ports, the mount commands
start to fail with EIO.  Then after a few dozen of these, the mounting
process hangs.  Sometimes it will BUG because freed & poisoned memory
is passed to kthread_stop().  I haven't seen some of the other
subsequent issues that Daniel initially reported.
