What are the issues with the design compared to how you're approaching 
virtio-scsi?

I don't see how a VMM that doesn't share the source code for it's 
backends or doesn't implement standard ABIs is any different than the 
hundreds of hardware vendors that behave exactly the same way.

We haven't even been successful in getting the Xen folks to present 
their work on lkml before shipping it to their users.  Why would we 
expect more from VMware if we're willing to merge the Xen stuff?
