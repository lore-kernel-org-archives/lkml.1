The fact that I can spot a missing release buffers and you, apparently,
can't does lend credence to a claim of greater expertise in the SCSI
area.

To get upstream, there first has to be a fix.  I've already explained
why I don't think the patch in question is a fix.

OK, so why don't you humour me and try applying the diagnostic patch I
sent you on the 24th of January?  I think there's a loop in I/O
completion caused by some type of timing race, and starved list handling
is the prime candidate.

You're asking me to ignore root cause analysis and push patches as "bug
fixes" just because they hide the problem on your machine.

Well, you not responding to requests for information for three weeks
(before deciding the it was unnecessary to provide it) may have helped
elongate the time scale ...

However, I'm not really interested in recriminations.  Since you already
know better than me what the bug is, simply explain here what the patch
actually fixes and it can go upstream with my blessing and whatever ego
boosting praise you require.
