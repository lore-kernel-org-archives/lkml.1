Amen.  I understand that v4 wants to extend across domains, etc., but it
goes out of its way to prevent the use of uids/gids, which in the vast
majority of installations would work just fine and wouldn't incur the
overhead of the mapping/unmapping operations.  There's no reason
uids/gids couldn't coexist with string names.  If the 4.0 spec had a
slightly different version of this paragraph:

   To provide a greater degree of compatibility with previous versions
   of NFS (i.e., v2 and v3), which identified users and groups by 32-bit
   unsigned uid's and gid's, owner and group strings that consist of
   decimal numeric values with no leading zeros can be given a special
   interpretation by clients and servers which choose to provide such
   support.  The receiver may treat such a user or group string as
   representing the same user as would be represented by a v2/v3 uid or
   gid having the corresponding numeric value.  A server is not
   obligated to accept such a string, but may return an NFS4ERR_BADOWNER
   instead.  To avoid this mechanism being used to subvert user and
   group translation, so that a client might pass all of the owners and
   groups in numeric form, a server SHOULD return an NFS4ERR_BADOWNER
   error when there is a valid translation for the user or owner
   designated in this way.  In that case, the client must use the
   appropriate name@domain string and not the special form for
   compatibility.

i.e., take out the "subvert" portion, and just plain allow string
representations of uids/gids, then at least the conversion would just be
an atoi and itoa.  Even better, allow the uids/gids to be used directly
and avoid the atoi/itoa, perhaps with a flag.  Either case is better
than idmapd and getting EDELAY and an X-second pause in odd places
because NFS has to go to userspace for a translation.
