Well, that's pretty abstractable, surely?  However, there is an
interesting question of what the best hypervisor interface actually is.

SRP is the protocol transfer abstraction.  It's just a way of packaging
up SCSI commands for transfer over a DMA protocol (OK, so it was
envisaged that the DMA protocol would be RDMA, but a hypervisor
interface is also a DMA protocol).

Well, it is really ... hopefully all the hypervisor interfaces won't
decide to be completely incompatible, so there's a good chance of code
sharing between them.
