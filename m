I was trying to err on the safe side, in case anyone wanted the separate
patches, on the grounds that it's easier to bake a cake than to unbake one.
If it's preferred, I can pre-bake them into one big patch before sending
next time.  Also, not all the patches are authored by me, so I figured I
ought to preserve that.

Maybe.  I'll take a look at it.

Ok.

Maybe.  There are complications.  We present some physical devices
(tape drives, changers, the RAID controller) some logical (logical
drives), the RAID controller is scsi revision 0, not 5, if we
present it first, the REPORT_LUNS is never sent by the upper layers
because of this, and only 7 devices get discovered, etc.  If we
present the first logical drive first, it sends the REPORT LUNS
to the the drive, etc.  It gets a little weird, as our hardware is
a little weird.  If it is possible, I doubt I would be able to have
such a change ready by 2.6.33 timeframe.

Ok.

It didn't seem to work until I did that.  this was awhile ago that I 
wrote this so my memory of it isn't too clear, but as I recall, I tested
this (in cciss, which is what this code evolved from) with a tape drive
with the long timeout set rather short, and "mt -f /dev/st0 erase"   The
artificially shortened timeout would mean that the erase would time out,
and this reset code would get triggered.  I found that without my change,
the device didn't become ready in time, even though the upper layers sent
TURs, and the device would get kicked off.  So I put in that code to make
it work.  Maybe it was the mid layer that needed tweaking?  maybe the slow
to recover tape drives deserved to get kicked off?

Yeah, mainly backward compatibility.

HP's array config utility (ACU), snmp storage agents,
firmware flashing utilities, cciss_vol_status,
arrayprobe, to name a few things,  depend on the passthrough ioctl
and there is more complete error information returned by the passthrough.
I also have a vague recollection of some buffer size limitation with SG_IO
I'm not sure, might be wrong about that, but I know flashing firmware
takes some large buffers.

Ok.  I think there are some in there we didn't even use.  We should
probably omit them in those cases.
