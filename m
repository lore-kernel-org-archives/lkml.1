Do they expose that sector size?
I.e., does ioctl(fd,BLKSSZGET,&ss) set ss to 4096?

I'm interested because I'm preparing GNU Parted's partition table
manipulation code (not its FS code) for just that.
In particular, now I've heard two stories:

  - disk makers will eventually sell drives with >512-byte sectors

  - some disk makers have sort of agreed not to do that, and
      expect forever to hide the larger underlying sector size
      behind a virtual 512 (of course, this imposes alignment
      restrictions, but that's a smaller problem)

Even if the latter is the case, we still have to deal with
optical and flash, both of which can already have larger sectors.

Speaking of O_DIRECT, both dd and shred (both in coreutils), use
O_DIRECT, so you could get _some_ coverage just by running shred
and experimenting with dd's oflag=direct and iflag=direct options.
