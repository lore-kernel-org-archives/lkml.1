Entirely incorrect.

You really need to get the fuck over yourself.

That's nice.  Why not take a look in drivers/block?  Floppy, CCISS,
CPQDA, UMEM, UBD, loop, NBD, SX8, UB, AoE, and many more.

sd and sr are block drivers.  In fact, the whole SCSI subsystem ...

        depends on BLOCK

Just take a look at sd.c.  The init code reads:

        for (i = 0; i < SD_MAJORS; i++)
                if (register_blkdev(sd_major(i), "sd") == 0)
                        majors++;

Then look at struct scsi_cmnd.  It has a pointer to the block request
that was passed down to it.  struct scsi_device has a pointer to the
block request_queue that's associated with the device.  Block is what
has elevators and io schedulers -- that work isn't duplicated by scsi.
There's work to push more of scsi's infrastructure up into the block
layer, so non-scsi block devices can take advantage of it.
