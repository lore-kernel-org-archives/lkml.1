Not true.  Thre is *NOTHING* in target_core_mod's configfs layout that
is "iSCSI centric", or $FABRIC centric at all.  We are talking about
configfs symbolic links with /bin/ls from target_core_mod storage
objects and $FABRIC_MOD portal group ports for $FABRIC LUNs.  How
Initiators logging into those $FABRIC_MOD endpoints (Node ACLs) and
accessing those $FABRIC LUNs (LUN ACLs) is still $FABRIC dependent.  

There is nothing iSCSI, SCSI, ATA or NBD centric about it, it is UNIX
centric and works generically across any fabric, that is the whole point
of having target_core_mod.  Why would we want to limit the generic
target engine to having Parallel SCSI (see below) centric ACLs..?

Wrong.  For iSCSI, Section 2.1 of RFC-3720 defines it as TargetName +
TargetPortalGroupTag, and this is the method that all of my upstream
work and any proper implemention of target node endpoint and target
portal group assignement.

Your example limits all iSCSI ACLs to TargetName, instead of TargetName
+TargetPortalGroupTag.

That is why everything related to iscsi_target_mod operation is
below /sys/kernel/config/target/iscsi/$IQN/$TPGT and
not /sys/kernel/config/target/iscsi/$IQN.  

Obviously I am not going to limit my upstream iscsi_target_mod to an ACL
structure that does not take into account a complete RFC-3720
implementation, but I would be more than happy to see you update your
ACL code to reflect proper TargetName+TargetPortalGroupTag that RFC-3720
lays out for the iSCSI Target Port <-> SCSI Target Port mapping.

I don't really care about history, I care about code.  Why don't you
start breaking out which code you want to go upstream so that it makes
my job easier or start integrating your own ACL control model into
drivers/lio-core/target_core_configfs.c and post a patch and then we can
discuss!

In all honesty however, the ACL code is a small nit-pick compared to how
we are going to merge your $FABRIC <-> $TARGET API with
drivers/lio-core.  Why don't you start there first while I consider what
can be made generic for ACL code for the target_core_mod configfs
upstream work.

Heh, why do you think I moved my upstream work to ConfigFS..?  Being
able to use two 'mkdir -p' and two 'ln -s' to create two iSCSI Initiator
Node ACLs and four iSCSI Initiator Node ACLs is as easy as it gets!?

Being able to call a *SINGLE* mkdir -p to create Network Portal on an
iSCSI Target Portal Group, and from an unloaded iscsi_target_mod preform
four different iSCSI target mod ops is a simple as it gets

target_core_mod is a generic target engine that uses the most advanced
and complete iscsi_target_mod, so one must put effort into understanding
the drivers/lio-core/*configfs* to understand the simplicity of the
code.

You are still completely missing the point here..  Because I broke out
my projects *LEGACY* information code (just like every other upstream
project is required to do) I do not have gigantic nested loops in my
target_core_mod and iscsi_target_mod code that can only dump output
using seq_file() out of procfs or through god awful IOCTL code.

Every other upstream project that *HAS* broken out its legacy
informational code into sysfs (which again, has the same limitiation) or
another sane virtual FS control interface (like configfs) is working
just fine.  Sysfs is used by people on many many millions of Linux
boxes, and all existing upstream projects that use sysfs have no problem
getting lots and lots and lots of info using /bin/cat even with the
PAGE_SIZE limitiation in place.  

So this means you have two choices:

*) Fix your legacy code to use a sane informational output interface for
your upstream branch.  

*) Produce a patch to solve the limitiation and produce an API and post
it to linuxfs-devel.

Again, for my upstream work with iscsi_target_mod, everyone will just be
using '/bin/cat' and wildcards (*) to grok the thousands
of /sys/kernel/config/target/iscsi/$IQNs configfs objects running on the
production systems.  Because of this reason, I am not pained by this
limitiation (as some of your code appears to be) so please don't expect
me to produce this patch.
