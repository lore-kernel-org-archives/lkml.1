This is pretty significant.  We have on several occasions in recent years
tightened up the argument checking on long-standing system calls and it's
always a concern that this will break previously-working applications.

And now it has happened.

If we put buggy code into the kernel then we're largely stuck with it: we
need to be back-compatible with our bugs so we don't break things like
this.

That wasn't noise - it was quite valuable.  Thanks for all the work you did
on this.


Given that our broken-by-unbreaking code has been out there in several
releases there isn't really any point in rebreaking it to fix this - the
offending applications need to be repaired so they'll work on 2.6.22 and
2.6.23 anyway.
