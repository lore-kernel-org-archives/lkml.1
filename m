I love it.  In the past I've lost time by working with patches which
didn't quite realize that ext3 holds a transaction open during
->direct_IO.

I can test the patch to make sure that it catches mistakes I've made in
the past.  Peter, do you have any interest in seeing how far we can get
at tracking lock_page()?  I'm not holding my breath, but any little bit
would probably help.
