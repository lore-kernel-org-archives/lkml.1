except in the case of a journaling filesystem, where the journal in
theory obviates the need for a fsck.  (yes, I know... fsck still has a
place...)  But, fsck is largely meaningless until the journal has been
recovered anyway (fs can only be consistent if it includes uncommited
transactions in the journal), so isn't this new territory?

I guess looking to the man page for clarification of intent is no help...

              ro  Mount the file system read-only.

I'm admittedly playing devil's advocate here :)  but what, in the
historical non-journalled filesystem case, would be writing to the
device anyway, if all IO from the vfs were stopped?  Without the
journal, isn't vfs-ro the same as bdev-ro, largely?

As a counter example, if you had a filesystem which saves it's last
mount time in the superblock; should a ro mount not update that time?
(perhaps not, depending on how that timestamp was intended to be used.)

You might not damage the underlying filesystem, but you could sure go
off in the weeds trying to read it, if you stumbled upon some
half-updated metadata... so while it may be safe for the filesystem, I'm
not convinced that it's safe for the host reading the filesystem.

but it's already changed, and has been in linux since ext3 came on the
scene.  mount -o ro -does- replay the journal.  Surely readonly does not
imply that we want a corrupted filesystem if it was not cleanly shut
down.  I suppose there is a place for the argument that a readonly mount
of a journaled filesystem -should- present a recovered filesystem to the
user, without actually recovering the log to disk.  I guess to me, it
hardly seems worth the effort, as the precedent is long set for doing
recovery on a read-only mount.
