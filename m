Thanks.  That patch is certainly dangerous and meant more as a request
for help!  :)

That said, the most important thing I still don't understand is the tree
root forward and back refs.  

In particular I don't think BTRFS is adding all the forward and back
refs in the snapshot of snapshot case.

The will make snapshot deletion difficult because one cannot tell if the
tree root is still being referenced by another tree root (or not)...

Anyway, I think that's still the first thing to be cleaned up.
