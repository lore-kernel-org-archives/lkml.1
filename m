Great, I'll hold off including the other two patches until a new posting
of the main patch.

You are right, a strict mempool solution will not be feasible (or at
least it will be very wasteful). I guess a temporary solution would be
to add __GFP_NOFAIL for this allocation.

I'm not sure there IS a better solution, just noting that it's a bit of
a shame to grow it that much...

Doing a quick check, bio_pair is 248 bytes on x86-64 currently. struct
bio is around 80 bytes or so, bio_vec is 16 bytes. So that's about 200
extra bytes, making the bio_pair around 440 bytes or so - indeed a
sizable increase in size. The bio_pair is only used for rare splitting,
so it's not THAT big of an issue.

So lets just keep it as-is, I think.
