hm, git pull did not work?

hm, but these are small differences that do not impact bisectability, 
you could have done it ontop of what we have, instead of a rebase? Oh 
well.

thanks!

I've rebased tip/core/stacktrace and zapped the history of the old 
commits from that branch. Would have been really nice to preserve the 
sha1 space and not force a rebase, like Linus is requesting it so 
frequently.

Had you done a git pull from me i could have carried this feature too 
without creating conflicts, instead of it disappearing in your tree 
for months and being hidden up until v2.6.29. This whole 'distributed 
development' stuff that's all the rage ;-)

i also regenerated tip-core, so it should now be conflict-free in 
Stephen's tree too. (Stephen, please holler if you still get 
conflicts)
