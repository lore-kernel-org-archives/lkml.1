q->max_sectors MUST always be <= q->max_hw_sectors, otherwise we could
be sending down requests that are too large for the device to handle. So
that condition would be a big bug. The sysfs interface checks for this,
and blk_queue_max_sectors() makes sure that is true as well.

The fixes proposed still look weird. There is no phys vs hw segment
constraints, the request must adhere to the limits set by both. It's
mostly a moot point anyway, as 2.6.28 will get rid of the hw accounting
anyway.
