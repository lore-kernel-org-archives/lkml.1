  I don't think this makes any difference. Look: We have transaction A
modifying block B fully committed to the journal. Now there is a running
(or committing, it does not really matter) transaction R also modifying block
B. Until R gets fully committed, no block modified by R is checkpointed
to the device - checkpointing code takes care of that and it must be so
to satisfy journaling guarantees.
  So if we abort journal (for whatever reason) before R is fully committed,
no change in R will be seen on the filesystem regardless whether you
cleanup the journal or not.
  And you cannot do much differenly - the principle of journaling is that
either all changes in the transaction get to disk or none of them. So until
the transaction is properly committed, you have the only way to satisfy
this condition - take the "none of them" choice.
  Now fsck could of course be clever and try to use updates in not fully
committed transaction but personally I don't think it's worth the effort.
  Please correct me if I just misunderstood your point...
