It's possible that the NFS write path as it exists after this commit  
is not marking certain pages dirty at the same time as others.  An  
asynchronous flush call from the VM would catch some of the dirty  
pages, then later, others, resulting in the pages flushing to the  
server out of order.

However, I poked around a little bit in late model kernels yesterday  
and found that the changes from Trond I referred to earlier are  
already in 2.6.27.  These rework this area significantly, so reverting  
this hunk alone will be more difficult in recent kernels.

In addition I notice that one purpose of this commit is to change the  
page locking scheme in the NFS client's write path.  I wouldn't advise  
simply adding this nfs_mark_request_dirty() call back in.  It could  
result in deadlocks for certain workloads (perhaps not your specific  
workload, though).

A more thorough review of the NFS write and flush logic that exists in  
2.6.27 is needed if we choose to recognize this issue as a real problem.
