To remove any suspicions that I'm playing dirty games here I should note 
that in many cases I can't say what exactly is responsible for good SCST 
performance. I can say only something like "good design and 
implementation", but, I guess, it wouldn't be counted too much. 
SCST/iSCSI-SCST from the very beginning were designed and made with the 
best performance in mind and that has brought the result. Sorry, but at 
the moment I can't afford doing any "why it's so good?" kinds of 
investigations, because I have a lot more important things to do, like 
SCST procfs -> sysfs interface conversion.

Thanks,
Vlad
