thanks for this detail, I would not have expected a partially degraded 
raid 6 array to be this sensitive to problems.

assuming that the degradation happens prior to the power failure, what 
could be done to make this safer and more predictable.

off the top of my head (and possibly an extreme performance hit, not 
nessasarily suitable for everyone) is there something that could be done 
with ordering the writes to the various drives?
