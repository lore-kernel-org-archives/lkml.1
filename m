Here (Like below) Just zero the very last byte in the buffer.
The first time this buffer was strcpy to, it was including the null terminated
string. then written to inode on disk. When read, at most it could be,
is as space allocated at inode (including null). If intentionally damaged, the symlink
will be corrupted but Kernel is safe.

You don't need to search and fail here. All you need is to NULL terminate on
read_i_size() + 1 of inode. The length of the written string was set on write-time
the buffer is big since it is a full page and I think symlinks are limited to
less then that.

If a person damaged the symlink inode on disk (set different size) then
the data is corrupted but Kernel is still safe.

Above will not fail this change is not needed

Same here

I hit this problem too, while developing a filesystem that was based
on ext2. The reason that it works is because the remainder of a page is always
Zero'ed out on writes. Then when read, you receive back your zero terminated link.
(Which means that if you have a symlink exactly 4k it will BUG but I guess
that is not possible).

The solution is to use the i_size information for the string length, and zero
terminate at i_size + 1.

The way I fixed it is that I Zero out the last page's remainder on read and not
on write like ext2 and other do it. (A symlink is less then 4k, right?)
