And it looks like I did get it wrong in some way.
I handled a barrier by:
   - send an empty barrier to each component
   - schedule to write with the barrier flag cleared
   - send another empty barrier

If an empty barrier is received, step 2 sends an empty non-barrier,
which caused the BUG.
I have revised the code to special case empty barriers and only perform
the first step.
This should appear in the next -next.
