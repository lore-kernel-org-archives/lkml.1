I know that you use different hardware. I used 'ratio' word.


BTW, you said the performance difference of dio READ is 38% but I
think it's 27.3 %, though it's still large.

I don't know he used the same benchmark software so I don't think that
we can compare them.

All I tried to say is the OFED version might has big effect on the
performance. So you might need to find the best one.

I'm talking about a target machine (I think that Pete was also talking
about OFED on his target machine). STGT uses OFED libraries, I think.
