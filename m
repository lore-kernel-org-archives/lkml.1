  Execly  ERR_BAD_DX_DIR treats  the same as bh == NULL and let's look at
  callers code: 
  struct buffer_head * ext3_find_entry(......)
  {
  .......
              bh = ext3_dx_find_entry(dentry, res_dir, &err);
                /*
                 * On success, or if the error was file not found,
                 * return.  Otherwise, fall back to doing a search the
                 * old fashioned way.
                 */
                if (bh || (err != ERR_BAD_DX_DIR))
  <<<<< after ext3_dx_find_entry() has failed , but don't set err pointer 
  <<<<< we get  (bh == NULL, err == 0) , and then just return NULL.
                        return bh;
 .......
 }

I've chosen this approuch becouse of:
1) this approuch was used in block allocation code.
2) this approuch prevent  folowing errors:
  *error = do_some_function(.....)
  ........ /* some code*/
  if(error) 
 we do this checking as we do it thousands times before, but forget
 what error it pointer here. And compiler can't warn us here because 
 it is absolutely legal operation. At least it is better to rename 
 error to errorp.

Btw: I've thought about adding assertations to error path witch may check
what errp pointer was properly initialized after error happends.

do_split() already invoked ext3_std_error() on it's "journal_error" path.
