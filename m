This really has very little to do with root vs non-root users.  In fact,
we're working towards having cases where we have many "root" users, even
those inside namespaces.  It is also quite possible for a normal root
user to fork into a new pid namespace.  In that case, root simply won't
be able to use this feature because something like:
	
	echo $$ /debugfs/tracing/set_ftrace_pid
	
just won't work.  Let's look at a bit of the code.

+static void ftrace_pid_func(unsigned long ip, unsigned long parent_ip)
+{
+       if (current->pid != ftrace_pid_trace)
+               return;
+
+       ftrace_pid_function(ip, parent_ip);
+}

One thing this doesn't deal with is pid wraparound.  Does that matter?

If you want to fix this a bit, instead of saving off the pid_t in
ftrace_pid_trace, you should save a 'struct pid'.  You can get the
'struct pid' for a particular task by doing a find_get_pid(pid_t).  You
can then compare that pid_t to current by doing a
pid_task(struct_pid_that_i_saved, PIDTYPE_PID).  That will also protect
against pid wraparound.

The find_get_pid() is handy because it will do the pid_t lookup in the
context of the current task's pid namespace, which is what you want, I
think.
