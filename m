This doesn't make much sense to me.  When a disk has grown there's no
point in invalidating any buffers, and when it has shrunk it's too late
already.  Also I suspect modern filesystems might be really allergic to
this kind of under the hood actions.  That is if they use the bdev
mapping at all, something that at least xfs and I think btrfs aswell
don't do at all.
