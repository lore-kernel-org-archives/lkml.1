Mapping master/slave is not difficult -- each should be a separate 
target, just like with parallel SCSI.

The issue with master/slave and simplex is guaranteeing that only _one_ 
command may be executing at a time, for a given set of targets, i.e. 
only one command per master/slave pair, only one command per pair of 
simplex ports (== 4 ATA devices max).

Originally this was done by setting can_queue==1, cmd_per_lun==1, and 
assigning each master/slave pair to a different Scsi_Host.
