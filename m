one of us is misunderstanding barriers here.

you are understanding barriers to be the same as syncronous writes. (and 
therefor the data is on persistant media before the call returns)

I am understanding barriers to only indicate ordering requirements. things 
before the barrier can be reordered freely, things after the barrier can 
be reordered freely, but things cannot be reordered across the barrier.

if I am understanding it correctly, the big win for barriers is that you 
do NOT have to stop and wait until the data is on persistant media before 
you can continue.

in the past barriers have not been fully implmented in most cases, and as 
a result they have been simulated by forcing a full flush of the buffers 
to persistant media before any other writes are allowed. This has made 
them _in practice_ operate the same way as syncronous writes (matching 
your understanding), but the current thread is talking about fixing the 
implementation to the official symantics for all hardware that can 
actually support barriers (and fix it at the OS level)
