Yes, my point was that they likely do fall back (degrade) to the
wait-on-the-list (non-spinning) behavior with dbench, and that's why
the performance numbers are similar (5-10% IIRC) to those of the
'normal' mutex.

And the thing is that for the highly contention mutexes, it's not easy
to switch back to the (fast) spinning-wait -- just because most of the
time there is someone waiting for the lock (and if this 'someone' is
not a spinner, none of the new mutex_lock() requests can do
busy-waiting/spinning).

But whatever, without the list_empty() check it's not relevant any more.

Yeah, for the "owner == NULL" case. If the owner was preempted in the
fast path right after taking the lock and before calling
mutex_set_owner().

btw., I wonder... would an additional preempt_disable/enable() in the
fast path harm that much?
We could avoid the preemption scenario above.
