My suggestion was that you stop trying to document your assertion of an issue 
and actually suggest fixes in code or implementation. I really don't think that 
you have properly diagnosed your specific failure or done sufficient. However, 
if you put a full analysis and suggested code out to the MD devel lists, we can 
debate technical implementation as we normally do.

As Ted quite clearly stated, documentation on how RAID works, how to configure 
it, etc, is best put in RAID documentation.  What you claim as a key issue is an 
issue for all file systems (including ext2).

The only note that I would put in ext3/4 etc documentation would be:

"Reliable storage is important for any file system. Single disks (or FLASH or 
SSD) do fail on a regular basis.

To reduce your risk of data loss, it is advisable to use RAID which can overcome 
these common issues. If using MD software RAID, see the RAID documentation on 
how best to configure your storage.

With or without RAID, it is always important to back up your data to an external 
device and keep copies of that backup off site."
