  I definitely agree with you :). This was just the first version of the
patch, more like a proof-of-concept, and it was easier to code against
jbd/ext3 for me :) But when I have something more definitive, I'll port it
against jbd2/ext4.

  This is an interesting idea. I'll have a look how hard would it be to do
that. It would be also good because we could separate the patch into
several chunks and it would still compile / work between them.

  "can't start a new transaction while commiting" is a fundamental problem
that you cannot add to a journal when you are trying to clean it up. It's
not just a locking problem :). As Mark pointed out, there's another problem
with the fact that we cannot afford to take page_lock while committing
because that's essentially a clasical lock inversion between a transaction
start and a page lock. How to solve that one, I don't know yet.
  To your question about delayed allocation - currently, we just skip those
buffers so as you write in some other email, you basically get the
guarantees of writeback mode. Actually, I guess the result is the same with
the old way of ordered-mode handling since you cannot afford to do the block
allocation from the commit code as well... We could get around this
limitation (actually easier than in the old code) if we were sure we have
enough credits in the transaction to really do the allocation - we would
do the allocation in the writepage() and attach changed buffers to the
committing transaction.
