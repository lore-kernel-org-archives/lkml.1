It's a sad and very annoying fact of life that most BIOSs suck.  If they
didn't suck, our bios handling code wouldn't be a nasty mess of
exceptions, work arounds and quirks.

Can we fix this so that both the DL585 and the opteron multi root stuff
can work?  There's a large population of DL585's out there, so we can't
release 2.6.32 like this ... and I'd rather not have to choose between
breaking the DL585's and breaking the Sun Opterons.
