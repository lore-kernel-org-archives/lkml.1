I tried that and it doesn't work. Furthermore passing a volatile void *
to a function expecting a void * provokes a compiler warning.

I currently think that defining and using

void secure_bzero(void *p, size_t n)
{
	memset(p, 0, n);
	/* We need for this memset() to be performed even if *p
	 * is about to disappear (a local auto variable going out
	 * of scope or some dynamic memory being kfreed()).
	 * Thus we need to fake a "use" of *p here.
	 * barrier() achieves that effect, and much more.
	 * TODO: find a better alternative to barrier() here.
	 */
	barrier();
}

would be a first good step. We can then ask the gcc folks for
a weaker alternative to barrier() that's guaranteed to keep the
object at [p, p+n[ live.
