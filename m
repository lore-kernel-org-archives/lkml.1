I believe you made the first change in response to my prodding at the time,
when libata was not returning valid sense data (no LBA) for media errors.
The SCSI EH handling of that was rather poor at the time,
and so having it not retry the remaining sectors was actually
a very good fix at the time.

But now, libata *does* return valid sense data for LBA/DMA drives,
and the workaround from circa 2.6.16 is no longer the best we can do.
Now that we know which sector failed, we ought to be able to skip
over it, and continue with the rest of the merged request.

One thing that could be even better than the patch below,
would be to have it perhaps skip the entire bio that includes
the failed sector, rather than only the bad sector itself.

I think doing that might address most concerns expressed here.
Have you got an alternate suggestion, James?
