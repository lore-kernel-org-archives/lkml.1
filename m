a configurable memory usage limit notification. The feature
was presented at the April 2009 Embedded Linux Conference.

+Memory Limit Notificiation
+
+Attempts have been made in the past to provide a mechanism for
+the notification to processes (task, an address space) when memory
+usage is approaching a high limit.  The intention is that it gives
+the application an opportunity to release some memory and continue
+operation rather than be OOM killed.  The CE Linux Forum requested
+a more comtemporary implementation, and this is the result.
+
+The memory threshold notification is a configurable extension to the
+existing Memory Resource Controller.  Please read memory.txt in this
+directory to understand its operation before continuing here.
+
+1. Operation
+
+When a kernel is configured with CGROUP_MEM_NOTIFY, three additional
+files will appear in the memory resource controller:
+
+	memory.notify_threshold_in_bytes
+	memory.notify_available_in_bytes
+	memory.notify_threshold_lowait
+
+The notification is based upon reaching a threshold below the memory
+resouce controller limit (memory.limit_in_bytes). The threshold
+represents the minimal number of bytes that should be available under
+the limit. When the controller group is created, the threshold is set
+to zero which triggers notification when the memory resource controller
+limit is reached.
+
+The threshold may be set by writing to memory.notify_threshold_in_bytes,
+such as:
+
+	echo 10M > memory.notify_threshold_in_bytes
+
+The current number of available bytes may be read at any time from
+the memory.notify_available_in_bytes
+
+The memory.notify_threshold_lowait is a blocking read file.  The read will
+block until one of four conditions occurs:
+
+    - The amount of available memory is equal or less than the threshold
+      defined in memory.notify_threshold_in_bytes
+    - The memory.notify_threshold_lowait file is written with any value (debug)
+    - A thread is moved to another controller group
+    - The cgroup is destroyed or forced empty (memory.force_empty)
+
+
+1.1 Example Usage
+
+An application must be designed to properly take advantage of this
+memory threshold notification feature.  It is a powerful management component
+of some operating systems and embedded devices that must provide
+highly available and reliable computing services.  The application works
+in conjunction with information provided by the operating system to
+control limited resource usage.  Since many programmers still think
+memory is infinite and never check the return value from malloc(), it
+may come as a surprise that such mechanisms have been utilized long ago.
+
+A typical application will be multithreaded, with one thread either
+polling or waiting for the notification event.  When the event occurs,
+the thread will take whatever action is appropriate within the application
+design.  This could be actually running a garbage collection algorithm
+or to simply signal other processing threads they must do something to
+reduce their memory usage.  The notification thread will then be required
+to poll the actual usage until the low limit of its choosing is met,
+at which time the reclaim of memory can stop and the notification thread
+will wait for the next event.
+
+Internally, the application only needs to
+fopen("memory.notify_available_in_bytes" ..) or
+fopen("memory.notify_threshold_lowait" ...), then either poll the former
+file or block read on the latter file using fread() or fscanf() as desired.
+Comparing the value returned from either of these read function with the
+value obtained by reading memory.notify_threshold_in_bytes will be an
+indication of the amount of memory used over the threshold limit.
+
+2. Configuration
+
+Follow the instructions in memory.txt for the configuration and usage of
+the Memory Resource Controller cgroup.  Once this is created and tasks
+assigned, use the memory threshold notification as described here.
+
+The only action that is needed outside of the application waiting or polling
+is to set the memory.notify_threshold_in_bytes.  To set a notification to occur
+when memory usage of the cgroup reaches or exceeds 1 MByte below the limit
+can be simply done:
+
+	echo 1M > memory.notify_threshold_in_bytes
+
+This value may be read or changed at any time.  Writing a higher value once
+the Memory Resource Controller is in operation may trigger immediate
+notification if the usage is above the new threshold.
+
+3. Debug and Testing
+
+The design of cgroups makes it easier to perform some debugging or
+monitoring tasks without modification to the application.  For example,
+a write of any value to memory.notify_threshold_lowait will wake up all
+threads waiting for notifications regardless of current memory usage.
+
+Collecting performance data about the cgroup is also simplified, as
+no application modifications are necessary.  A separate task can be
+created that will open and monitor any necessary files of the cgroup
+(such as current limits, usage and usage percentages and even when
+notification occurs).  This task can also operate outside of the cgroup,
+so its memory usage is not charged to the cgroup.
+
+4. Design
+
+The memory threshold notification is a configurable extension to the
+existing Memory Resource Controller, which operates as described to
+track and manage the memory of the Control Group. The Memory Resource
+Controller will still continue to reclaim memory under pressure
+of the limits, and may OOM kill tasks within the cgroup according to
+the OOM Killer configuration.
+
+The memory notification threshold was chosen as a number of bytes of the
+memory not in use so the cgroup paramaters may continue to be dynamically
+modified without the need to modify the notificaton parameters.
+Otherwise, the notification threshold would have to also be computed
+and modified on any Memory Resource Controller operating parameter change.
+
+The cgroup file semantics are not well suited for this type of notificaton
+mechanism.  While applications may choose to simply poll the current
+usage at their convenience, it was also desired to have a notification
+event that would trigger when the usage attained the threshold.  The
+blocking read() was chosen, as it is the only current useful method.
+This presented the problems of "out of band" notification, when you want
+to return some exceptional status other than reaching the notification
+threshold.  In the cases listed above, the read() on the
+memory.notify_threshold_lowait file will not block and return "0" for
+the remaining size.  When this occurs, the thread must determine if the task
+has moved to a new cgroup or if the cgroup has been destroyed.  Due to
+the usage model of this cgroup, neither is likely to happen during normal
+operation of a product.
