You use GART IOMMU. So I thought that you shouldn't hit this problem
because an IOMMU gives an unique dma address per dma mapping... but I
forgot one really important thing about GART, it's not real IOMMU
hardware. It does address remapping only when necessary (an address
can be accessed by a device). It's possible that you see multiple DMA
transfers performed against the same dma address on one device at the
same time.

Yeah, now it's clear for me why you hit this bug.

I'm not sure there is any simple way to fix dma-debug wrt this. I
think that it's better to just disable it since 2.6.30 will be
released shortly.
