i'm not sure how to do direct debugging on udev, so i can only guess 
about what effect on the kernel side could have caused this. One bad 
hack would be to "probe" udevd's behavior by changing the NET_TR entry 
in various ways:

  "tr" -> "token-ring"         # breaks
  "tr" -> "tr"                 # works
  "tr" -> "token-rin0"         # ?            (1)
  "tr" -> "TR"                 # ?            (2)

the question is, does tweak (1) and tweak (2) work or break?

but it would be a lot more effective i guess to get some udevd expert's 
attention on this ...
