I can confirm this as a regression.  You don't even need to mount it
as a root filesystem, or do this on an 68k system.  On my x86 system,
using a kernel based off of git commit: afa26be8 (6 commits after
2.6.26-rc1), mounting an ext3 filesystem, you can cause an oops by
taking an ext2 filesystem and forcing a mount as ext3, "mount -t ext3
/dev/closure/textext2fs /mnt").  (see below for my oops).  This does
not occur with a kernel based off of 2.6.25, so it's a definite
regression.

Looks like the problem is some of the recent quota cleanups.  The
problem is that ext3_fill_super is returning an error, because the
journal is missing.  get_sb_dev() calls ext3_fill_super, and upon
receiving an error, it is calling deactivate_super(), which calls:

	     DQUOT_OFF(s, 0);

(line 182 in fs/super.c, in deactivate_super(), recently modified just
after 2.6.25, at comment 0ff5af8340aa6be44220d7237ef4a654314cf795,
although I'm not sure this is actually the problem commit)).  

The blow up is happening because the because superblock was not fully
set up, and the comment in the commit involved mentioned cleaning up
what is supposed to happen when remounting a filesystem turning quota
on or off.  I'm guessing that the changes didn't take into account
that DQUOT_OFF() can get called with a partially set-up superblock,
which will happen when the filesystme specific get_sb() code refuses a
mount and returns an error.

Jan, can you take a look at this and confirm whether or not this is
the root cause of the crash?

Thanks!!
