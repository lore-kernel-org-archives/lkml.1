I haven't add any at this moment, but I thinks some people may want
to move some pages in page-cache from one cgroup to another cgroup.
When that time comes, I'll try to make the cost minimized that
I will probably only update the link between a page_cgroup and
a bio_cgroup and leave the others untouched.

The problem is that every time the lock is held, the associated
cache line is flushed.

I don't think I can agree to this.
When multi-sized-page-cache is introduced, some data structures will be
allocated to manage multi-sized-pages. I think page_cgroups should be
allocated at the same time. This approach will make things simple.

It seems like the on-demand allocation approach leads not only
overhead but complexity and a lot of race conditions.
If you allocate page_cgroups when allocating page structures,
You can get rid of most of the locks and you don't have to care about
allocation error of page_cgroups anymore.

And it will also give us flexibility that memcg related data can be
referred/updated inside critical sections.

Bio-cgroup just expects that the call-backs bio-cgroup prepares are called
when the status of a page_cgroup get changed.

But only if everyone allows me to add some new members into "struct page."
I think the same thing goes with memcg you're working on.


Thank you,
