The code was originally tuned to S-ATA & ATA disk response times which 
are closer to 12-15ms. Sleeping for 10ms (100HZ kernel) or 4ms (250HZ) 
did not overly penalize the low thread count case and worked well for 
higher thread counts (and ext3 special cases the single threaded writer 
so no sleep happens).

This is still a really, really good thing to do, but we need to sleep 
less when the device characteristics are radically different. For 
example, a fibre channel attached disk array drops that 12-15 ms down to 
1.5 ms (not to mention RAM disks!).

It would be great to be able to use this batching technique for faster 
devices, but we currently sleep 3-4 times longer waiting to batch for an 
array than it takes to complete the transaction.

Thanks!
