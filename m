Interesting.

I'm not seeing anything relevant, but I'm adding Al to the cc in, since 
the r/o bind mounts did change fs/namei.c and vfs_create/mkdir in 
particular. Not that I see why that would trigger either, but the changes 
to fs/ext3/namei.c seem to be even _less_ interesting than that.

One thing I note is that all the oopses seem to be i686 - are there that 
few x86-64 fc10 users (I'd have assumed that 64-bit is starting to be the 
norm for people who live on the edge, but perhaps I'm just out of touch)? 

Or could this perhaps be an indication that it is specific to i686 some 
way (eg a compiler issue?)
