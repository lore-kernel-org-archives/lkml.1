Hi Ryo,

I am not sure that upstream should really be worrying about RHEL 5.x.
cgroups is a relatively mature solution and is available in most (if not
all) community distros today. We really should not be looking at another
grouping solution if the sole reason is that then dm-ioband can be used
on RHEL 5.x. The correct solution would be to maintain a separate patch
for RHEL 5.x then and not to burden the upstream kernel.

My objection is slightly different. My objection is that there are too
many interfaces to do the same thing. Which one of these is the
recommended one? WHich one is going to be supported? If we say that
cgroups is not the preferred interface, do the application developers
need to use yet another library for io control along with cpu/memory
control?
