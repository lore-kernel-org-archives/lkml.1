Assume the following situation:
Filesystem with blocksize < pagesize - suppose blocksize = 1024,
pagesize = 4096. File 'f' has first four blocks already allocated.
(line with "state:" contains the state of buffers in the page - m = mapped,
u = uptodate, d = dirty)

  process 1:                       process 2:

write to 'f' bytes 0 - 1024
  state: |mud,-,-,-|, page dirty
                                   write to 'f' bytes 1024 - 4096:
                                     __block_prepare_write() maps blocks
                                       state: |mud,m,m,m|, page dirty
                                     we fail to copy data -> copied = 0
                                     block_write_end() does nothing
                                     page gets unlocked
writepage() is called on the page
  block_write_full_page() writes buffers with garbage

This patch fixes the problem by skipping !uptodate buffers in
block_write_full_page().
