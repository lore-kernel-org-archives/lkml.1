<grin>

It's the s_umount semaphore that is the problem here - freeze_bdev()
does a get_super() call which does a down_read(&sb->s_umount) and
the corresponding up_read() call does not occur until the filesystem
is thawed.

So yes, your umount will hang until you thaw the fileystem.

As i just tried this, I can't unfreeze the filesystem because it's
been removed from /proc/mounts already and so xfs_freeze -u aborts:

budgie:~ # xfs_freeze -u /dev/sdb8
xfs_freeze: specified file ["/dev/sdb8"] is not on an XFS filesystem
budgie:~ #

So I couldn't reproduce the unclean shutdown.

IMO, an unmount of a frozen fileystem should simply return EBUSY.

Kernel bug. umount should know nothing about frozen filesystems...

Maybe something like th patch below needs to be done to prvent
the hang....

Cheers,

Don't try to unmount a frozen filesystem as the unmount will hang
waiting on the s_umount semaphore held by the freeze and you may not
be able to unfreeze the filesystem to allow the umount to proceed.
