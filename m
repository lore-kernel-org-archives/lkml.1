Ok, I think you're right, and I think that this fix is correct and makes 
the symptom go away.

I may be completely confused here, but:

- The deferred requests should be getting cleaned up by timing out, and 
that does not not seem to be happening, (Is this true?)

- By releasing the underlying connection prior to releasing the 
transport that manages it, we've converted the visible resource leek to 
an invisible one.

- This has been around forever and changing the client side close 
behavior graceful exposed this bug,

So I'm wondering if what we want to do here is to provide a mechanism 
for canceling deferred requests for a particular transport. This would 
provide a mechanism for the generic transport driver to force 
cancellation of deferred requests when closing.
