  Actually, leaving that file in the filesystem can potentially lead to
strange effects because eventually the inode "spip%3Farticle19.f8740dca"
points to gets reallocated and then you can get e.g. a hardlinked
directory. On the other hand having it lost+found should be safe enough.

  Cool, I'll try to cook up something then.

  I don't need to go that far (at least for now) but thanks for the offer.

  Yes, again this confirms that the inode was just correctly deleted. But
somehow a pointer to it remained in the directory.

  Yes, this is a consequence of the bug - somebody deleted an inode because
i_nlink dropped down to 0 but the inode was in fact still referenced.
