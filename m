Other drivers have had to convert to and modify the host tagging to get 
merged. They too had stable and fast code, and we complained and fought 
against changing it :) I have had to convert or help convert libfc and 
qla4xxx and I will now convert iscsi, so I feel your pain :)

To create the map call scsi_init_shared_tag_map after you allocate the 
scsi host and before you add it. Then in slave_alloc set the 
sdev->tag_supported  = 1 and call scsi_activate_tcq. Then replace your 
bitmap with:

for scsi commands:

c = h->cmd_pool + scsi_cmnd->request->tag

And for the reset path I was thinking you could use my patch in the 
other mail and do

tag = blk_map_start_tag(scsi_host->bqt, NULL, 0);
if (tag < 0)
	goto fail;
c = h->cmd_pool + tag;
c->cmdindex = tag;

In the completion path you need to do a blk_map_end_tag(scsi_host->bqt, 
c->cmdindex);. The scsi/block layer will free the tag for scsi commadns.
