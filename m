I hit almost the same BUG, so tried out this patch, and can confirm that
it fixes the BUG. Other devices still work too. As it's 2.6.26-rc9 it might
be time to send this patch upstream, before it's too late.

Any idea why my cardreader doesn't work in the first place though?

The error is basically:

It's a new Trust Mini Cardreader, model CR-1350p.

It doesn't matter in which port I put the thing (front, back),
and I've tried older kernels too (2.6.12), but I get the same
error there. This is with an Intel 945G chipset.
(I've no Windows to test if it works there.)

Is it just a crappy device which I should bring back, or is
there more going on?

Greetings,

Indan
