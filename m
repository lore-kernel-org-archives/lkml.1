Can you stop the argument, "exofs is similar to the existing
traditional file systems hence it should be treated equally". It's
simply untrue. Does anyone except for panasas people insist the same
argument?

We are talking about the design of exofs, which also affects the
design of OSD ULD (including the library) living in SCSI
mid-layer. It's something completely different from existing
traditional file systems that work nicely on the top of the block
layer.

As discussed in another thread, now OSD ULD reinvents the bio handling
infrastructure because of the design of exofs. But OSD ULD can use the
block layer helper functions to avoid the re-invention if we change
the exofs design to take pages instead of bios. For now, it works
perfectly for exofs. In the future, we might change it but we don't
know until you submit patches (or the performance results) that show
taking pages doesn't work for exofs nicely.

I guess that we need to evolve the block layer to support OSD stuff
cleanly than we've discussed recently. But again we can do when we
definitely need to do.
