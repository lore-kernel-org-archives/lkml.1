There is another configuration that fails. Use partitioned md. I do not 
think it matters whether over whole device or with a partition table. 
Neither grub nor lilo will boot off from it. I've tested that exensively 
with a partition on the disks.  I am using PXE boot to boot 2 servers 
with that configuration. That adds a dependency on the pxe boot server, 
but considering the function of those servers they are moot if that pxe 
server is dead anyways....
