Yes, I think so.  I'm suspecting that
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/posix_fallocate.html
is just buggy.  Or I can't read.

I mean, if we're going to support negative `len' then is the byte at
`offset' inside or outside the segment?  Head spins.

However it would be neat if someone could test $OTHER_OS and, perhaps more
importantly, the present glibc emulation (which I assume your manpage is
referring to, so this would be a manpage test ;)).

The above opengroup page only permits S_ISREG.  Preallocating directories
sounds quite useful to me, although it's something which would be pretty
hard to emulate if the FS doesn't support it.  And there's a decent case to
be made for emulating it - run-anywhere reasons.  Does glibc emulation support
directories?  Quite unlikely.

But yes, sounds like a desirable thing.  Would XFS support it easily if the above
check was relaxed?
