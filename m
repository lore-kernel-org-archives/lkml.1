So, given the command at issue was:

luna ~ # mount -o remount,rw /usr

We're seeing the second case where mount is merging all the options in
/etc/fstab into the options passed into the remount command. How is
the filesystem expected to behave in these difference cases? The
first simply changes the ro/rw status, the second potentially
asks for the filesystem to change a bunch of other mount options
as well, which it may not be able to do.

So what is the correct behaviour? Should the filesystem *silently
ignore* unchangable options in the remount command, or should it
fail the remount and warn the user that certain options are not
allowed in remount?

Cheers,

Dave.
