This group is running a sequential reader. How can you call it an inactive
group?

I think that whole problem is that like CFQ you have not taken care of
idling into account.

Your solution seems to be designed only for processes doing bulk IO over
a very long period of time. I think it limits the usefulness of solution
severely.

I think we can easily extent io scheduler based controller to also support
max rate per group policy also. That should not be too hard. It is a
matter of only keeping track of io rate per group and if a group is
exceeding the rate, then schedule it out and move on to next group.

I can do that once proportional weight solution is stablized and gets
merged. 

So its not an advantage of dm-ioband.

We talked about this point in the past also. In io scheduler based
controller, just move all the tasks to root group and you got a system
not doing any io control.

By the way why would one like to do that? 

So this is also not an advantage.

I think this is more of a disadvantage than advantage. We have a very well
defined functionality of cgroup in kernel to group the tasks. Now you are
coming up with your own method of grouping the tasks which will make life
even more confusing for users and application writers.

I don't understand what is that core requirement of yours which is not met
by io scheduler based io controller. range policy control you have
implemented recently. I don't think that removing dm-ioband module
dynamically is core requirement. Also whatever you can do with additional 
grouping mechanism, you can do with cgroup also.

So if there is any of your core functionality which is not fulfilled by
io scheduler based controller, please let me know. I will be happy to look
into it and try to provide that feature. But looking at above list, I am
not convinced that any of the above is a compelling argument for dm-ioband
inclusion.

Thanks
Vivek
