I agree, that change looks good.

Right, it was part of the bigger SSD optimization stuff I did a few
revisions back.

Yes agree on that too. We probably should make a different flag for
hardware raids, telling the io scheduler that this device is really
composed if several others. If it's composited only by SSD's (or has a
frontend similar to that), then non-rotational applies.

But yes, we should pass that information down.
