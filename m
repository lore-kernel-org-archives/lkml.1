Great!

Yes, doing things in userspace, when possible, is much better.  But, a change 
in the partition table has to be relayed to the kernel, and when that change 
happens to be on a mounted disk, then the partition manager complains of not 
being able to update the kernel's view.  So how can this be addressed?
