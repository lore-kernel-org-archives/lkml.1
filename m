So what? He clearly knows how it works.

Instead of arguing he's wrong, will you simply label everything as

Look, I don't need full drive failure for this to happen. I can just
remove one disk from array. I don't need power failure, I can just
press the power button. I don't even need to rebuild anything, I can
just write to degraded array.

Given that all events are under my control, statistics make little
sense here.
