Yes.

Well, in case of flashcard and degraded MD Raid5, ext3 does _not_
address metadata inconsistency problem. And that's why I'm trying to
fix the documentation. Current ext3 documentation says:

#Journaling Block Device layer
#-----------------------------
#The Journaling Block Device layer (JBD) isn't ext3 specific.  It was
#designed
#to add journaling capabilities to a block device.  The ext3 filesystem
#code
#will inform the JBD of modifications it is performing (called a
#transaction).
#The journal supports the transactions start and stop, and in case of a
#crash,
#the journal can replay the transactions to quickly put the partition
#back into
#a consistent state.

There's no mention that this does not work on flash cards and degraded
MD Raid5 arrays.

It claims so, above.

Ack here.

Cool. So... can we fix the documentation?
