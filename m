I have ordered a couple 4 port boards (that are PCI-e x4), my next plan
of action to acquire > 600MiB/s is as follows:

Current:
Mobo: 6 drives (full speed)
Silicon Image (3 cards, 2 drives each)

Future:
Mobo: 6 drives (full speed)
Silicon Image (3 cards, 1 drive each)
Four Port Card in x16 slot (the 3 remaining drives)

This should in theory allow 1000 MiB/s..
