Mail server deletes is the common one I can think of.  Mail server
creates end up bound by fsync in my testing here, so it doesn't quite
show up unless your IO subsystem is much faster than your kernel.

Benchmarks in the past on large IO rigs have shown it.  It isn't
something you're going to see on a regular sized server, but for AIO +
O_DIRECT, the pieces that hold i_mutex can be seen in real life.

[ re: pipes, ok I don't know of realistic pipe benchmarks but I'll run
them if people can suggest one ]

I ran a mailserver delivery simulation (fs_mark), and then my standard
dbench/4k creates/4k stats on ext3 and ext4.

ext3 had very similar scores with spinning on and off.

ext4 scored the same on mailserver delivery (fsync bound apparently)

For the others:

dbench no spin: 1970MB/s
dbench spin:    3036MB/s

(4k creates in file/sec, higher is better)
4k creates no spin: avg 418.91 median 346.12 std 306.37 high 2025.80 low 338.11
4k creates spin:    avg 406.09 median 344.27 std 179.95 high 1249.78 low 336.10

Somehow the spinning mutex made ext4 more fair.  The 4k create test had
50 procs doing file creates in parallel, but each proc was operating in
its own directory.  So, they shouldn't actually be competing for any of
the VFS mutexes.

The stat run was the same patched/unpatched, probably for the same
reason.

None of this is very earth shattering, apparently my canned benchmarks
for btrfs pain points don't apply that well to ext34.
