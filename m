Ok - sorry for my ignorance about SCSI - but my sources (i.e. Arjan) tell 
me that the problem is that Link in ATA land means something different than 
Link in SCSI land, and that what I really need to do is leave this code under
the Host class, but rename it to something that more accurately reflects
what it means under SCSI.  So, is the word "segment" more appropriate?
Should I rename the file to "segment_power_management_policy"?

Thanks,
