Sorry. I think the mail server has problem with attachment. The patch
is here in plain text. Sorry for the inconvenience. I have problem with
linux-scsi mail list, if you have comment please cc me. Thanks.

After reset completed, the scsi error handler sends out TEST_UNIT_READY
to
the device. For 'normal' devices this command will be handled by
firmware.
However, because the RAID console only interfaces to scsi mid layer, the
firmware will not process this command for it. This will make the
console
to be offlined right after reset. Add the handling in driver to fix this
problem.
