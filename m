Other callbacks return -errno on failure and 0 on success, so I make this new
callback behave the same, and the errno will be returned by the mount command.

But it seems true/false is more reasonable, then if it returns false, mount can
return EINVAL.

I'll document the return value.

Seems better.

Yes, the patch does nothing actually. Daisuke Nishimura-san's original swap
controller needed to be mounted with memory controller, but the newer
version makes it an addon to memory controller, so it currently doesn't
need the feature this patch provides.

Or I can keep this patch until some new cgroup subsystem needs it ?
