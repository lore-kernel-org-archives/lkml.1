It's all the fault of those annoying computer systems that do what we
tell them rather than what we intend.  In this case sysfs won't allow
you to write a read only attribute even if it does have a store method.

The existing feature set currently works, even with the event filter
removed, so it's the fastest and smallest bug fix to get polling to
work.  I'm just pointing out that your suggested fix wouldn't work ... I
think at -rc6 the more complex one involving two bits is really a
feature enhancement.

It's fixed, and nothing else is additionally broken by the current fix.
