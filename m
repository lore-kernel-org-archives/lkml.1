Sure, but asking all people who might eventually have to use it
to always watch any possible interface addition isn't practical.

I would have hoped that the fact that the interface required loading
a module and immediately removing it by hand is suboptimal enough
that it wouldn't have gotten in in the first place.

Well, in the case I'm looking at, udev is what's loading the host
controllers, and there needs to be some sort of synchronization point
between that and LVM invocations, fsck, mount, etc. Since scans
aren't sent over as events for udev to catch, 'udevadm settle'
isn't enough. Removing, loading, and removing scsi_wait_scan works
here, but it just seems like a kludge.

I can trigger a load of scsi_wait_scan when hosts are registered
in udev, but that's still ugly, and sort of overkill.
