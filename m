What do you mean close gracefully? If you are doing IO to the disk you 
can wait for the host to reconnect and execute the IO. If you are going 
to wait for as long as it takes (or for whatever you have setup in the 
host (see the iscsi documentation/README on open-iscsi.org about the 
replacement_timeout)), and you do not want to see the dump then you can 
do what the dump says and do this I think:

echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs" disables this message.

If you want to just disable the message I guess you can do that. But I 
do not think we should even get that far. We should not be firing the 
scsi eh in this case in the first place. I think that might be a bug. I 
attached a patch which will give us more infomation. You can just send 
that output to the iscsi list.
