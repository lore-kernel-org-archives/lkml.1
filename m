Fedora enables it by default and seems that we got some bogus bug
reports. I like not to see any bogus bug reports about v2.6.30. So I
prefer to disable dma-debug feature.

As Torsten pointed out, this bug happens on common and sane
configurations. And if you want to write the same contents to two
places on disk, AIO and DIO is a reasonable solution, I think.

Joerg patch weakens the checking capability. IMHO, it's the wrong
direction.
