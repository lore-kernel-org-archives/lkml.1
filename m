Another possibility would be to simply re-point
sbi->s_journal->j_commit_callback() to a function like this:

static void new_commit_callback_func(journal_t *journal, transaction_t *txn)
{
	do_new_callback_stuff(journal, txn)
	release_blocks_on_commit(journal, txn)
}

Or Luster could initialize ext4, and then intercept the callback,
stash it away in a pointer, and then do this:

static void new_commit_callback_func(journal_t *journal, transaction_t *txn)
{
	do_new_callback_stuff(journal, txn)
	(*orig_value_of_j_commit_callback)(journal, txn)
}


If you want to be even *more* general, we could hang a struct
list_head off of struct ext4_sb_info which contains the linked list of
functions to be called, one of which would be release_blocks_on_commit(), 
and then change sbi->s_journal->j_commit_callback to point to a function
which iterates over the functions in the list_head
sbi->s_commit_callback_funcs.

Do you have specific use in mind for Lustre?  Could one of the above
schemes work for you?
