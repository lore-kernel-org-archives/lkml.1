Because the syscall accepts a different format (user_desc) than it gives
back (desc_struct, which is the kernel format), conversion must occur,
either during checkpoint or during restart.
I prefer in restart: because checkpoint is more performance critical,
because it allows - in the future - to directly insert the data bypassing
the syscall (like openvz), and because we may need conversions anyway in
restart, e.g. to restart a 32 bit app on a 64 bit kernel.

Just shorter.

It is: cr_uread() expects "void *", while "*addrs" is "unsigned long".

This is needed for a VMA that has modified pages but is read-only: e.g. a
task modifies memory then calls mprotect() to make it read-only.
Since during restart we will recreate this VMA as read-only, we need to
temporarily make it read-write to be able to read the saved contents into
it, and then restore the read-only protection.

setup_arg_pages() is unrelated, and the code doesn't seem to have much in
common.

nr_pages is the number of pages _saved_ for this VMA, that is, the number
of pages to follow to read in. If it's zero, we don't read anything (the
VMA is had no dirty pages). Otherwise, we need to read that many addresses
followed by that many pages.

The name is misleading, should be:  cr_pgarr_reset().  What happens is
that we allocate the chain of cr_pgarr on demand. Once done with one MM,
we reset the state and reuse the same chain until we need to expand it.
I renamed and added comments about it in the next version.

Not a security hole: this is only for private memory, so it never
modifies the underlying file. This is related to what I explained before
about read-only VMAs that have modified pages.

The process is restarting, inside a container that is restarting. All
tasks inside should be calling sys_restart() (by design) and no other
process from outside should be allowed to ptrace them at this point.

(In any case, if some other tasks ptraces this task, it can make it do
anything anyhow).

Good point, thanks.
