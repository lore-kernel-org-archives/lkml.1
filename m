That's right. ac->ac_b_ex.fe_len is the number of blocks that account
for the original request. It is used for update the per-fs free blocks
counter and the per-fs dirty(delayed) blocks counter too. Quota counters
are updated based on this value.

I'll send out a patch shortly.

If this is a real concern, I am all for fix it.  Just we have consider
the worse case before, at that time it seems a little overprotect that
we have always account for the worse case. In regularly cases, we pretty
much always reserve more metadata(indirect) blocks than needed...
