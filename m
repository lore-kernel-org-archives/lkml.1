I know we *could* sweep through all the block drivers altering them; my
point is that I don't think we *should*.  Fundamentally, every driver
that cares is assuming req->data_len is the length of the request that
came down.  The fact that it got padded is irrelevant (and actually
detrimental) to most of them as the SMP driver illustrates.

We use a high dma_alignment not because we care about padding, but
because we want to avoid scatter gather.  So we care about alignment of
the start of the buffer (to avoid sg), but fundamentally, we need to
know what its true length (not its padded length) is.  The true length
feeds into the smp frame size and is checked by the interfaces, which is
why the changes caused an SMP failure.

Just for the principle of least surprise, can we not keep req->data_len
what it has always been, namely the true data length of the request and
express the fact that we've padded it by req->extra_len or something, so
we don't have to do all of these driver changes.

But this is true of *every* current user of the block layer apart from
IDE ... we all care about alignment not padding.  Any current user that
actually cares about padding will be doing their own adjustments, so
they need changing anyway.

We can frame that with a different API, but blk_queue_dma_alignment()
better be the common case (start but not pad alignment).

Right, and currently, apart from IDE, they all want it to mean the true
data length.

I think it *is* the common case.

But we still have to find all the bugs this causes in all the block
drivers ... that's my biggest concern right now.

OK, so can we go back to data_len being the true value and add an
extra_len for drivers who want to know where the padding lies?
