I am finally getting some time to look at my problem that I originally 
reported in October (SUNRPC problem with 2.6.26 and beyond), and I am 
seeing the same behavior as Max Kellermann when my machine slows as I 
described earlier.  The system in question is currently running 
2.6.27.7.  Here is what I see when it is misbehaving:

samples  %        image name               app name                 
symbol name
11380517 57.4191  sunrpc.ko                sunrpc                   
rpcauth_lookup_credcache
3263657  16.4664  sunrpc.ko                sunrpc                   
generic_match
1081287   5.4555  vmlinux                  vmlinux                  
copy_user_generic_string
499407    2.5197  vmlinux                  vmlinux                  
__posix_lock_file
[...]

And here is what I see when I stop the programs that are chewing up all 
the system time, and then starting them up again:

samples  %        image name               app name                 
symbol name
6372650  21.7978  vmlinux                  vmlinux                  
copy_user_generic_string
5401386  18.4755  sunrpc.ko                sunrpc                   
rpcauth_lookup_credcache
3018753  10.3257  vmlinux                  vmlinux                  
__posix_lock_file
1050095   3.5919  sunrpc.ko                sunrpc                   
generic_match


and I am not using Kerberos with NFSv4 (i.e. no rpc.gssd).  Did you ever 
find a solution for this problem with rpcauth_lookup_credcache?
