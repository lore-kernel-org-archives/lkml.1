ret is the transferred size, right? I don't see any check for  
success/failure in below code.

That's not true, there are many cases when transfer failed eventually
but some bytes are valid. Even the simple read/write case. Imagine a 
very large transfer with last sector encounter a "bad sector". that can
be critical, (trying to rescue a disk). And many other examples.

Code is as strong as it's weakest link, right? If lower driver/firmware
is brain-dead, what can we do? But why give up where you can do better?

The scsi standard is very clear about what every one should do with the residual
and what it means at every stage, everyone should do his part. Here at the middle
layer we need to correctly translate what lower level returned and pass it up the
chain.

Must stacks are amateuristic in regard to error handling but some are not, what
should we strive for, if we can?

Should we check for errors then?

It is defined, as I explained before. But yes no one uses it in Kernel.
The "good" low-level drivers fix it up by setting resid to zero, in that
case. (other wise the upper layers might crash)
