Unfortunately, that's likely not the entire hot fix ... the implication
is that we have some mapping error in the way we do direct SG_IO.

What the fix you propose does is make it far more likely that block will
copy, perform I/O then uncopy (almost certain, since most smartd data
transfers are well under ATA_SECT_SIZE, which is 512).  However,
implicating a generic path like this implies that we would get the same
problem for SCSI commands as well, so the correct hot fix is below.

However, I'd like to see if we can track the problem through the SG_IO
direct path ... how many adjacent page bytes are corrupt?  Just a few or
a large number (I'm wondering if it's an off by one or off by alignment
type bug)?
