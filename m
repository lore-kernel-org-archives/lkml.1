Ok, one more test. This time to show that with single queue and FIFO
dispatch a writer can easily starve the reader.

I have created two partitions /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2. Two ioband devices
ioband1 and ioband2 on /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 respectively with weights
40 and 20.

I am launching an aggressive writer dd with prio 7 (Best effort) and a
reader with prio 0 (Best effort).

Following is my script.

****************************************************************
rm /mnt/sdd1/aggressivewriter

sync
echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

#launch an hostile writer
ionice -c2 -n7 dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/sdd1/aggressivewriter bs=4K count=524288 conv=fdatasync &

# Reader
ionice -c 2 -n 0 dd if=/mnt/sdd1/testzerofile1 of=/dev/null &
wait $!
echo "reader finished"
**********************************************************************

Following are the results without and with dm-ioband

Without dm-ioband
-----------------
First run
2147483648 bytes (2.1 GB) copied, 46.4747 s, 46.2 MB/s (Reader)
reader finished
2147483648 bytes (2.1 GB) copied, 87.9293 s, 24.4 MB/s (Writer)

Second run
2147483648 bytes (2.1 GB) copied, 47.6461 s, 45.1 MB/s (Reader)
reader finished
2147483648 bytes (2.1 GB) copied, 89.0781 s, 24.1 MB/s (Writer)

Third run
2147483648 bytes (2.1 GB) copied, 51.0624 s, 42.1 MB/s (Reader)
reader finished
2147483648 bytes (2.1 GB) copied, 91.9507 s, 23.4 MB/s (Writer)

With dm-ioband
--------------
2147483648 bytes (2.1 GB) copied, 54.895 s, 39.1 MB/s (Writer)
2147483648 bytes (2.1 GB) copied, 88.6323 s, 24.2 MB/s (Reader)
reader finished

2147483648 bytes (2.1 GB) copied, 62.6102 s, 34.3 MB/s (Writer)
2147483648 bytes (2.1 GB) copied, 91.6662 s, 23.4 MB/s (Reader)
reader finished

2147483648 bytes (2.1 GB) copied, 58.9928 s, 36.4 MB/s (Writer)
2147483648 bytes (2.1 GB) copied, 90.6707 s, 23.7 MB/s (Reader)
reader finished

I have marked which dd finished first. I determine it with the help of
wait command and also monitor the "iostat -d 5 sdd1" to see how IO rates
are varying.

Notice with dm-ioband its complete reversal of fortunes. A reader is
completely starved by the aggressive writer. I think this one you should
be able to reproduce easily with script.

I don't understand how single queue and FIFO dispatch does not break
the notion of cfq classes and priorities?

Thanks
Vivek
