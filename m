Yes, good point.  I don't think any of the ext3 maintainers were aware
that the 3-years-old patch had introduced "abort on data error" behaviour.
The default for ext4 is only now going to errors=remount-ro from
errors=continue (as it is on ext2/3) so I think it is inconsistent to
have the journal abort on data errors when the filesystem itself does not.
