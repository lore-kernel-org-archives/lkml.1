But if they do not, then the behavior is wrong now, and I would prefer
it to be fixed, which is why this patch.

Does anyone really care about uid based grouping? (I do realize the
userspace daemon classifies on the basis of uids as of now, but still,
how many use cases really want uid based grouping as opposed to process
type (as in browser, compiler..) type of grouping)
