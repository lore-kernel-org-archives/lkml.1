That is a problem for me and David.  Do not let it concern you ... :-)

Please don't do that, please base each one on either Linus' tree or the
appropriate maintainer's subsystem tree as linux-next is a moving
target (for instance, if you had based the scsi ones on next-20081219,
then the scsi tree was not included ...).  Basing on Linus' tree should
work in most cases as there are not to many conflicts caused by these
patches (the tg3 one is the worst so basing that off the net tree is
probably worth while).
