Sorry, not entirely sure on the details here, it should just be a clean fs, no
idea how big.  I can't get ahold of the original reporter.

Hrm I thought it was reproduced on ext2, but looking back at the bz that wasn't
actually said, so I'm not sure if this happens on ext2.

Sorry I'm not sure, I'm waiting for the original reporter to pop back up so I
can get those details.

Agreed.  As soon as the original reporter pops back up again I will get some
more details from him and see about getting a more complete picture of what
exactly is going on.  Thanks,
