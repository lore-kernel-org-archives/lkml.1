For single-device drivers (not md/dm), not reordering should be good 
enough to claim barrier support.

So make some flag for these bio-based devices, so that they don't have to 
use one of those request-based options (which are meaningless for 
non-request based device).

BTW. What is the rule for barriers if the device can't prevent the 
requests from being delayed or reordered? (for example ATA<=3 disks with 
cache that lack cache-flush command ... or flash cards that do 
write-caching anyway and it can't be turned off). Should they support 
barriers and try to make best effort? Or should they reject barriers to 
inform the caller code that they have no data consistency?
