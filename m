  Of course you can but it can happen in data=ordered mode as well (if the
machine crashes before the transaction is committed). The percieved
difference is in the fact that kjournald starts its commit every 5 seconds
while pdflush starts writeback every 30-35 seconds. So if you use
data=guarded/writeback mode and set dirty_expire_centisecs to 500, the
experience wrt. data loss is going to be similar to data=ordered mode.
fsync with heavy background writers won't be that painful as in data=ordered
mode but apart from that the performance will be probably comparable.
