I had run a few tests against this...the assumption was that since ext3
doesn't have writepages I should be able to easily show using WRITE_SYNC
made for fewer merges and lower performance.  But, the write cache on my
array happily ate the smaller requests and came out just as fast.

So, your sqlite example made me think of something different:

mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb
mount /dev/sdb /mnt
cd /mnt
tar xf /local/linux-2.6.tar
sync
sync
sync
echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

# step one, start an O_SYNC writer to trigger lots of WRITE_SYNC
# this 32GB file is big enough that my drive can't finish it before the
# tar is done.
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/foo bs=1M count=32000 oflag=sync &

# step two, time how long it takes to read the linux-2.6 dir
# from above
time tar cf /dev/zero /mnt/linux-2.6 &
wait %2
kill %1

/local/linux-2.6.tar is a full kernel tree after compiling with
debuginfo turned on and including the mercurial history files.  It has
2.2GB of files.  The goal here is to time how long it takes to read the
big directory tree in the face of a writer doing constant WRITE_SYNC
writes.  Time to read the directory tree:

With Ted's ext3 patches: 8m2s
Plain 2.6.29:            4m9s
