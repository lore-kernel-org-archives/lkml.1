Thanks!

Where did you get the errata from, and what kind of document / revision is it?
I have not seen that document so far.

I've asked Centaur to confirm the errata, also inquired whether there will be
a microcode update or a new stepping to fix it.  If yes, we should add proper
checks to the workaround to make sure it's only enabled when we need it.

Out of curiosity: Only the ACE (crypto) is affected, not PHE (hashing)?

I'll also put on my todo list to do some actual benchmarking to determine
how much impact this bug has.  I expect especially for storage encryption,
many crypto operations will be page aligned and thus need the extra memcpy :(

p.s.: the patch to enable padlock on x86_64 is already in the crypto-dev tree,
as far as I know.  Interestingly, I have not observed this problem so far,
despite running dm-crypt on a nano for quite some time. 

Cheers,
