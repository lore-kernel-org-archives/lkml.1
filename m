Hi Joel,

After some more thought and a few hours of effort, I was able to get
some code up using the model above between a new target_core_configfs.ko
and iscsi_target_mod.ko (LIO-Target):

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/nab/lio-core-2.6.git;a=commit;h=1a48fb089e1ee1cff5ef02b401d365fdf206cf69

The one symbol that I required out of fs/namei.c for vfs_mkdir() that
was not available was lookup_hash(), and the symbol is exported in the
commit so that
drivers/lio-core/transport_core_configfs.c:do_configfs_rmdir() works as
expected.  There is another version of do_configfs_rmdir() that uses the
exported lookup_one_len(), but that one is not working just quite yet.
Perhaps there is value in lookup_hash() being defined as
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL().

Now that the basic configfs structure between a generic engine <->
fabric is in place, the next steps will be to enable the LIO-Target  and
LIO-Core IOCTLs into make_group() and drop_item() calls.

Have a look and let me know what you think..  I will ping you when the
first pieces of LIO-Target functionality are up and running..

:-)
