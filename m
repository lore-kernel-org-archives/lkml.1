I was looking at this code recently because it looks really bizarre when
you create a half-petabyte filesystem:

$ sudo insmod drivers/ata/ata_ram.ko capacity=1099511627776 preallocate=0

[12095.028093] ata7.00: 1099511627776 sectors, multi 0: LBA48 NCQ (depth 31/32)
[12095.028093] ata7.00: configured for UDMA/133
[12095.041915] scsi 7:0:0:0: Direct-Access     ATA      Linux RAM Drive 0.01 PQ: 0 ANSI: 5
[12095.041915] sd 7:0:0:0: [sdc] Very big device. Trying to use READ CAPACITY(16).
[12095.041915] sd 7:0:0:0: [sdc] 1099511627776 512-byte hardware sectors (562949953 MB)
[12095.041915] sd 7:0:0:0: [sdc] Write Protect is off
[12095.041915] sd 7:0:0:0: [sdc] Write cache: disabled, read cache: enabled, doesn't support DPO or FUA

1. Avoiding 64-bit divisions is _so_ last decade.  We have
linux/math64.h, we should use it.

2. We should report in GB or TB when appropriate.  The exact definition
of 'appropriate' is going to vary from person to person.  Might I
suggest that we should report between two and four significant digits.
eg 9543 MB is ok, 10543 MB should be 10 GB.

3. I hate myself for saying this ... but maybe we should be using the
horrific MiB/GiB/TiB instead of MB/GB/TB.

4. I've been far too busy to write said patch.  Simon, would you mind
doing the honours?
