 	Hello Eric ,  Fyi ,  linux-2.6.21-rc4 + mpt-fusion(*) patches from 
Andrew Morton's patch tree .  Still gives me the ever looping reset .  But I 
have just found sometrhing of interest one of the Powersuplies in the cabiinet 
'May be' failing .  I have to test that to be satisfied that is the case .
 	I'll report back soon on the PS & please look into this .  There is no 
reason for the driver to keep a system in loop over a failing drive set .
 		Tia ,  JimL
