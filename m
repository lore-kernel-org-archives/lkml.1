Yes, they were ... it was actually Bill Irwin's patch.  The old problem
was that we fault allocations in reverse order (because we were taking
from the end of the zone list).  I can't remember when his patches went
in, but it was several years ago.  After they did, I was getting a 33%
chance of physical merging (as opposed to zero before).  Probably
someone redid the vm or the zones without understanding this and we've
gone back to the original position.
