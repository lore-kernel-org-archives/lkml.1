Hi,

the dm-raid45 target patch has been adopted by various distros for that
purpose since quite some time. It's providing  RAID4 and RAID5 mappings
but is not yet upstream.

Support for IMSM 9.0 is being integrated.

Like mentioned, IMSM 9.0 being supported via an Intel contribution.

Like us for dmraid about IMSM 9.0 and other features.

DM was initially designed to be container-style with respect to many
areas and that included it to be metadata agnostic in order to handle
any metadata formats in userspace.

Yes, you are working dm type features in since a while :-)

Agreed, we'd need face-time and talk issues through in order to come up
with any such plan for md+dm integration.

With the exception of clustered storage. There's no e.g. clustered RAID1
in MD.

Your ':-)' is adaquate because dmraid just got features added to
create/remove RAID sets and to handle spares recently with IMSM.
Other metadata format handlers in dmraid have to be enhanced to support
that functionality.

And dmraid.

dmraid already supports that since ever but goes by the different
approach to allow the metadata to be selected with the -f option, hence
ignoring any RAID sets with other metadata.

Maybe we are about to change that? ;-)
