Thanks for all the tips I've received this evening.  However, I figured out 
the problem late last night. :-)

I was only using the default 8 nfsd threads on the server.  When I raised 
this to 256, the read bandwidth went from about 6 MB/sec to about 95 
MB/sec, at 100ms of netem-induced latency.  Not too shabby.  I can get 
about 993 Mbps on the gigE link between client and server, or 124 MB/sec 
max, so this is about 76% of wire speed.  Network connections pass through 
three switches, at least one of which acts as a router, so I'm feeling 
pretty good about things so far.

FYI, the server is using an ext3 file system, on top of a 10 GB /dev/ram0 
ramdisk (exported async, mounted async).  Oddly enough, /dev/ram0 seems a 
bit slower than tmpfs and a loopback-mounted file - go figure.

To avoid confusing this with cache effects, I'm using iozone on an 8GB file 
from a client with only 4GB of memory.  Like I said, I'm mainly interested 
in large file performance. :-)
