I think that where-ever we put the splitting there is a lot to be gained by
make it easier to split things.

It is a while since I looked closely at this (about 30 months) but last time
I looked, low level devices were allowed to modify the bi_iovec.  This means
that a split has to copy the iovec as well as the bio which significantly
increased the complexity.  If we stored an index into the current bio in
'struct request' rather than using bi_idx plus modifying bv_offset, then I
think we could make bi_iovec read-only and simplify splitting significantly.

I have some patches that did this, but they are very old.  I could probably
refresh them if there was interest.


My preferred end-game would be to allow a bio of any size to be submitted to
any device.  The device would be responsible for cutting it up if necessary.
For the elevator code, I wouldn't bother making new bios, but would teach
'struct request' to be able to reference part of a bio.  So in the general
case, a 'request' would point to a list of bios, but would exclude a prefix
of the first and a suffix of the last. A single bio could then be referenced
by multiple requests if necessary.

It would probably make sense to include a 'max_sectors' concept to discourage
large bios as doing that would probably allow things to run more smoothly
in general.  But if this were a hint rather than a requirement then I think
it would make life a lot easier for a lot of code.
