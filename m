By complete security model, I don't mean it has to be MAC+DAC
+privileges.  Just that it does in fact implement a well formed security
model, not just an ad hoc set of stupid security tricks.  Smack and
SELinux are examples of the former.

"One of the explicit requirements to get LSM into the kernel was to have
the ability to make capabilities be a module.  This allows the embedded
people to completely remove capabilities, as they really want this.  I
don't think we can ignore this, no matter how much of a pain in the butt
it is :)" - Greg KH

Quoted from:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-security-module&m=99236500727804&w=2

Ironically, since that time, capabilities have doubled in size and still
can't be removed from the core kernel since LSM didn't push the state
into the security blobs.

If you do re-factor it in that manner, SELinux will have to register
under both schemes in order to preserve its current logic, of course.

And there are points of overlap between the two schemes even for
non-privilege-managing security modules (e.g. they both need hooks on
ptrace, inode_setxattr, etc).

Lastly, since LSM didn't really do the job of migrating the capability
state out of the core kernel data structures and fully encapsulating the
capability logic, you'd have to do that work too to do it right.
