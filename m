Ah, right.  I see, the async infrastructure is still in fs/super.c,
but the actual code to insert deleted inodes onto the s_async_list was
removed in commit b32714b.  Sorry, that confused me.

OK, so assuming that Venkatesh was using something post-rc1, I can't
suggest anything other than a full bisect.  Sorry....
