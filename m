Assuming all tasks are of same prio, then what you are saying is that
A/a1/tasks should cumulatively recv 1/(1 + N) of parent's share.

After some thought, that seems like a reasonable expectation. The only issue
I have for that is it breaks current behavior in mainline. Assume this
structure:

 	   /
 	   |------<tasks>
 	   |------<cpuacct.usage>
  	   |------<cpu.shares>
 	   |
 	   |----[A]
 	   |     |----<tasks>
 	   |     |----<cpuacct.usage>
 	   |     |----<cpu.shares>


then, going by above argument, /A/tasks should recv 1/(1+M)% of system
resources (M -> number of tasks in /tasks), whereas it receives 1/2 of
system resources currently (assuming /cpu.shares and /A/cpu.shares are
same).

Balbir, is this behaviour same for memory controller as well?

So pick any option, we are talking of deviating from current
behavior, which perhaps is a non-issue if we want to DTRT.

Should be possible, need to look closely at what will need to change
(load_balance routines for sure).
