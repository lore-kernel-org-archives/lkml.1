  Actually, it's not that simple. You want linear layout of blocks you are
going to read. That is not necessary a linear layout of blocks in a single
file - trace sometime a start of some complicated app like KDE. You find
it's seeking like a hell because it needs a few blocks from a ton of
distinct files (shared libs, config files, etc). As these files are mostly
read only, it's advantageous to interleave them on disk or at least keep
them close.
