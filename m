Introduction
------------
Checkpoint/restart (C/R from now) allows to dump group of processes to disk
for various reasons like saving process state in case of box failure or
restoration of group of processes on another or same machine later.

Unlike, let's say, hypervisor C/R style which only needs to freeze guest kernel
and dump more or less raw pages, proposed C/R doesn't require hypervisor.
For that C/R code needs to know about all little and big intimate kernel details.

The good thing is that not all details needs to be serialized and saved
like, say, readahead state. The bad things is still quite a few things
need to be.

How C/R works
-------------
User passes to system call pid of process which is the root of process hierarchy
to be saved. Hierarchy is formed wrt ->real_parent.

Processes which belong to this hierarchy are frozen.

C/R code walks in-kernel datastructures starting from task_structs and collects
references to them in one place for a dump. This includes at least mm_struct,
nsproxy and it's belongings, opened files, CPU registers, etc. More or less
anything which is userspace-visible must be dumped on one form or another.

Collected data structures are checked for sanity wrt several things:
- still unsupported features (hugetlb mappings) in which case
  checkpointing is aborted
- structure "leaks" to outside of selected group of processes.

  This is done by maintaining mirror refcount from structures collected and
  comparing it with real refcount. If discrepancy is noticed, structure is
  used by someone else who is not frozen and thus we're trying to checkpoint
  live data structure. Depending on what data structure is dumping live data
  structure can be pretty easy (uts_namespace requires only uts_sem)
  to pretty hard (net_namespace sockets requires... actually nobody knows
  what net_namespace will require).

  Note! There re multiple levels of correct operation implied:
	- kernel shouldn't oops by dumping live data structure
	- kernel shouldn't write inconsistent state by dumping live data structure

If all checks for all data structures are OK, C/R code walks
collected references in certain order and does actual serializing and
writes image to passed file descriptor.

This results in a file which is believed to contain enough information
to restore group of process to exactly same user-visible state as before
checkpointing module inevitable issues like time.

Image format design
-------------------
Image consists of image header, object images one after another and
terminator which is formally an object.

Image header consists of magic ("LinuxC/R") and image version (__le32).
This is immutable part of an image. The rest is defined strictly by image
version even the rest of image header.

	Nobody is making guarantees that image format is immutable!

Once again, image format will change, however it's guaranteed that
magic+version part will remain and image version will be bumped.

So far, image header consists of
a) arch of kernel which dumped image to signalize that you can't restore
   powerpc image on i386 kernel and hint code in case of restoring i386
   image on x86_64 kernel.

b) kernel version as found in utsname.

   This is done for distributions who eventually may want to support C/R.
   While the expected way to maintain migrating from older kernels is
   to write userspace converter which knows everything about two image
   formats, distro kernels may want to maintain all backward-caompat code
   in kernel which can be small or big depending on the amount of changes
   they pull into their kernel.

   Just image version isn't realistically sufficient, distributions are
   expected to leave image version alone and demultiplex backward-compat
   code depending on utsname which is in case of distro kernels is pretty
   well known.

Object image
------------
Object images are direct projection of in-kernel data structures which
can be shared inside kernel to disk :-) Example: struct mm_struct is
dumped to an object of KSTATE_OBJ_MM_STRUCT type, struct cred is dumped
to KSTATE_OBJ_CRED type.

There are so far 3 exceptions: VMA, page content and fd. These are formal
objects with type and length to simplify reading and restoration of VMAs
and file descriptors, respectively. VMA and pages attributed are even
variable-sized.

Any object image starts with object header which is object type,
object lenth including header and globally unique object id (per-image,
of course). Type and length are used in verifying that image is not
malformed and object id is used in references of objects to another objects
and also verifying.

VMA, pages and file descriptors don't get object id, because they aren't
directly collected. But this is fine, as they get invalid object id (0)
which is not checked.

Relations in image
------------------
To serialize reference of object A to object B (task_struct::mm) image of
object a gets a field of kstate_ref_t type:

	struct kstate_image_a {
		struct kstate_object_header hdr;

		kstate_ref_t	ref_b;
	};

which corresponds to a->b pointer.

Reference consists of position in a dumpfile (if it's known by the time B
is dumped and object id of B (which _is_ known).

If there is a loop in pointers A => B => A, position is dumped as 0 and attention
is required at restore time. In each loop case it will be dealt individually.
(so far, there is one loop: user->user_ns->creator)

C/R dump code tries hard to maintaint streamable property of dump process --
if dumpfile is opened with O_APPEND, it should work).


Changes in kernel internals:
- add struct file_operations::checkpoint hook

  Code which operated file knows better what information needs to be saved
  to allow successful restoration. For usual files on on-disk filesystem
  add generic_file_checkpoint().

  Add ext3 opened regular files and directories for start.

  If opened or references file doesn't have ->checkpoint hook, checkpointing
  is aborted -- this is deny-by-default policy.

- add struct vm_operations_struct::checkpoint

  Same as for files. Will be used more by vDSO code.

checkpoint(2), restart(2)
-------------------------
Exact number and semantics of system calls is WIP, it was correctly noticed,
that 'freeze' and 'dump' parts needs to be split apart to allow filesystem
sync after freeze. For now leave 2 syscalls for people to play with.

Splitting freeze/dump implies persistent C/R context state BTW which is not
the case now.

Checkpoint semantics
--------------------
Checkpointing is done on per-container level without "leaks" to outside.
In this kernel can provide promises to dump coherent start and to do it
without major games with data structures locking.

Works to allow reliable checkpoint on live data structures has been started
however it's unclear what the result will be because of even more thing one
has to keep inside head simultaneously.

As a semi-direct consequence checkpkointing is not allowed for ordinary
users. While it's a nice feature to allow it, they formally can't even
create container for themselves (CAP_SYS_ADMIN during nsproxy tweaks).

Regadless, once enabled this will present several security risks:
- anything in image is controlled by untrusted user who will try to check
  how well checking code on restart(2) is written.

  And, yes, nobody is hiding that restart(2) involves honest parsing of
  slightly more complex that string file format inside kernel.

- user who effectively can turn off ASLR randomization, because
  he controls VMA boundaries.

These two directions (checkpointing live and restart(2) for everyone)
aren't explored in this patchset because they are artificially not
independent right now and each one is hard enough for already hard C/R work.

Sorry.

However, code is kept good enough to add each of feature later.
