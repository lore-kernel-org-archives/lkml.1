Kernel threads freeze only when they call try_to_freeze().  User space tasks
freeze while executing the signals handling code.

Yes.  Kernel threads are not sent fake signals by the freezer any more.

Yes.  Please add show_state() before the last "return" in freeze_processes().

On 2.6.23.1 you can test the freezer alone by doing

# echo testproc > /sys/power/disk
# echo disk > /sys/power/state
