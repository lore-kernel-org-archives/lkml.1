I am not sure what you mean by "expect."

ext3 (and other file systems) certainly expect that acknowledged writes 
will still be there after a crash.

With your disk write cache on (and no working barriers or non-volatile 
write cache), this will always require a repair via fsck or leave you 
with corrupted data or metadata.

ext4, btrfs and zfs all do checksumming of writes, but this is a 
detection mechanism.

Repair of the partial write is done on detection (if you have another 
copy in btrfs or xfs) or by repair (ext4's fsck).

For what it's worth, this is the same story with databases (DB2, Oracle, 
etc). They spend a lot of energy trying to detect partial writes from 
the application level's point of view and their granularity is often 
multiple fs blocks....
