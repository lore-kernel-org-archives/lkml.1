I asked Japanese server vendor's people which default is preferred,
and they agreed on data_err=abort.  But it would not be true for
all users all over the world.

It's good point.  Well, how about setting the default depending on
"errors" option?  It means the default is data_err=ignore on
errors=continue and data_err=abort on errors=remount-ro/panic.
If it is confusing, I don't mind if the default is simply
data_err=ignore.
