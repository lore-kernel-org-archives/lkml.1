  I didn't realize PageDirty() is going to be already cleared by previous
writes... :(

  Well, we could do that but we'd have to change try_to_release_page() call
to accept an extra argument which would consequently mean changing all the
filesystems... But yes, it probably makes sence because it is really
different whether we should just release the page because of memory
pressure or because direct IO needs to write to that area of the file.
So adding the parameter to releasepage() callback is probably a reasonable
thing to do.
