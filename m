Correct.

Also correct.

But this patch is a reaction to reported behavior of a machine in
the field, with a shipping BIOS, and the problem was that we
only installed the handler in acpi_boot_ec_enable().

I understand the point you are making, but in this case, we do
know which came first (the chicken ;).

Maybe in the future, we'll be surprised again and discover that
we need to evaluate _PDC even earlier, but I prefer to fix that
problem later, if it ever occurs, than to worry about it now.

This patch fixes a real issue, so I prefer to focus on that
instead of worrying about a theoretical issue.

Thanks,
/ac, unless Len tells me I'm wrong
