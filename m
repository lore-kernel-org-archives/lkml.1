This is one of the things we currently do.  There are problems with it, 
not the least of which being that it's hard to know how long to wait, 
and waiting excessively long generates user complaints.

(I assume this is about scsi_wait_scan)

This isn't really true -- loading the module requires that a user is 
actually running the tools and knows to do it, which is rarely (and 
ideally never) the case.  And frankly, every single one of our users 
would have to do it.

So really, either way means we need to update the tools.  It also 
doesn't really solve the problem -- when I insert "usb-storage", the 
SCSI scan may still finish while we're still enumerating the bus for USB 
devices. (I'd be willing to believe I'm wrong about this specific 
example, but I suspect the principle still applies for some other driver.)

In practice, we wind up doing the compare/timeout loop as on 
/proc/scsi/scsi, but on /proc/bus/usb/devices or 
/sys/bus/ieee1394/drivers/sbp2 instead.

I wouldn't say I'm *happy* with the current situation, but we're to the 
point where it works for most users.

At the same time, we're moving towards polling on the hotplug socket, 
waiting for specific devices to appear from which to build and mount 
"/".  That should obviate the need for much of this in most cases.
