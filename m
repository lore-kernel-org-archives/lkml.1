The problem with 106 character --- I have 100-character display on one 
computer. If the code were be formatted for 106 characters, it would look 
like
					bla - bla - bla - bla - bla -
bla -
					bla - bla - bla - bla - bla - 
bla;

--- i.e. every second line wasted.

On the other hand, if you go without limit, it will be
					bla - bla - bla - bla -
bla - bla - bla - bla - bla - bla - bla - bla;

--- much better.

The same problem comes for 132 chatacters --- many people have 
128-character display (1024x768 framebuffer) and they see spurious 
wrapping with 132 character text.

In general, if you select "n" as a line width, you find someone with 
"n - delta" column display who will have problems.

It would be best to keep line length is unlimited and say that it is the 
responsibility of the viewer to wrap it.

And make limit of 80 characters only for block comments --- the reader 
doesn't want to read wrapped words in comments.
