This make sense to me.

Sure. We could check __GFP_FS and __GFP_WAIT, and that make sense.

Yes, it looks like page_cache_pipe_buf_steal() expects page is free
before removeing it by passing the GFP_KERNEL flag, but currently ext3
could fails to releasepage when it called. In fact try_to_release_page()
return value is ignored in page_cache_pipe_buf_steal(), should probably
checked the failure case.


The other caller of try_to_release_page() in mm/splice.c is
fallback_migrate_page(), which does want the synchronous behaviour to
make sure buffers are dropped.


I will reuse the GFP_WAIT and GFP_FS flag in the updated patch.

Thanks for your feedback.
