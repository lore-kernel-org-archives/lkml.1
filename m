Yes.

Once Vladislav is ready for his project to be merged, let him approach
us and ask.  I don't know if he considers his project ready for merging.
Did he ask you for his help?  It's generally considered rather rude to
merge someone else's code without their consent.  The way you tried to
get it merged was unhelpful and, if Vladislav were less skillful a
communicator, could have actively hindered getting it merged.

The correct way to have done this would have been to start a thread on
the scst mailing list asking whether the developers felt it ready to
merge.  Then *leave it to them*.
