This sentence no object ;-)

Yeah, but we need to do that for TRIM anyway.  While we're doing it for
TRIM, we might as well do it for UNMAP.

Sure, but you've got a relatively sane underpinning.  NAND is pretty
insane, and the aggregation can actually go a long way to helping with
some of the problems.

OK, but that's because you've implemented a single-range ioctl.  If we
had an ioctl which let you discard multiple ranges, it would actually
be faster (due to the barriers) than implementing a WRITE SAME.
