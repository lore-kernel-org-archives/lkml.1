That was the idea about the TIF_SINGLE_STEP bit. I can be set and later
unset if we don't want to deliver the SIGTRAP after all.

Ok, although it seems a bit strange not to do it. Perhaps I should add a

So after everthing has been converted to utrace we always will load the
control registers in FixPerRegisters.

We could use the same compare of the control registers as the code in
__switch_to. See below.

What the magic code in __switch_to does is to check if the next process
wants to use per and do the load of the control registers only if the
current set of control registers 9 to 11 differ from the set for the
next process.
The check if the next process wants to use per is done with a
test-under-mask (TM) instruction and a mask of 0xe8. This checks for 4
bits: em_branching, em_instruction_fetch, em_storage_alteration and
em_store_real_address. If one of the bits is set then the current set
of control registers is stored, compared with the set for the next
process and only if they differ is the lctlg done.
The store of control registers is cheap (n cycles for n registers), the
load is expensive for specific control registers. For 9 to 11 it costs
more than 100 cycles.

The PSW_MASK_PER is the "global" PER enablement switch, the PER_EM_MASK
bits enable the different PER events. We check for the PER_EM_MASK bits
because it is easier to access in __switch_to. The return PSW is stored
in the pt_regs structure, we would have to get a pointer to it (what
"regs = task_pt_regs(taks)" does in FixPerRegisters). In
FixPerRegisters we can as well use the PSW_MASK_PER bit.
