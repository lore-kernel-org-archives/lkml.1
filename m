The original question seemed to be about PATA. sysfs
attributes would be one solution. Another solution is
for libata to implement the SAT (ref: sat2r06.pdf at
www.t10.org) specific mode page called "PATA Control"
(see section 12.3.2). The latter solution may well work
with FCoE, iSCSI, FC, USB, 1394 and SAS. Currently there
is no SATA equivalent to that mode page.
In the PATA case surprise me and choose the better solution.

Getting to the host phy directly connected to a SATA disk
is a particularly thorny problem and a no go area for
sysfs in all but the direct connect case. For example
a SATA "host" phy connected to a SATA disk attached to
a SAS expander can be controlled via the SAS SMP protocol.

hdparm assumes the device it is talking to is a PATA or
SATA disk (with some support for the ATA part of an
ATAPI device). hdparm is now capable of talking to
such devices irrespective of whether the OS sees a
ATA transport (PATA or SATA) or one of those other (evil)
SCSI friendly transports (same list as above). My
sg3_utils are lower level utilities that mostly map
directly to SCSI or ATA commands. Feel free to write
a utility that unifies the attributes of
PATA/SATA/FC/SCSI/SAS/logical disks and OSD devices :-)

As for the freestanding ata_transport idea which transport
would a mvsas host adapter belong to which has one phy
connected to a SATA disk, another connected to a SAS disk and
a third one connected to a SAS expander with lots of SATA
disks the other side of that?
