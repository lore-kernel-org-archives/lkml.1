It's only vulnerable if the data leaks to a less trusted domain.
There is no domain crossing in your user-space example.
In the kernel case, the domain crossing would be as I wrote: leaking
recycled and uninitialized memory to user-space (and those leaks of
uninitialized memory are frowned upon and quickly fixed when discovered).
