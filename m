Not true.  Change the perm with chmod...

But furthermore, change 4d1566ed renders the userspace interface 
/inconsistent/ even for the read-only case that we all acknowledge 
_does_ work.

IOW, after your "fix", the userspace interface gives an incorrect 
picture of what events are/are not masked.


If you don't have the time to complete work on

	commit 285e9670d91cdeb6b6693729950339cb45410fdc
	Author: Kay Sievers <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>
	Date:   Tue Aug 14 14:10:39 2007 +0200

	    [SCSI] sr,sd: send media state change modification events

then revert _that_.

Don't break my patch, just because yours (which came _after_ mine) 
doesn't work.
