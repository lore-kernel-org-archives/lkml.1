2.6.20.4 with your patch dies in the memcpy (as does 21-gitN)

2.6.20.4 without your patch dies in the subsequent __free_page
with a null pointer ref at 000...008

James should I try your posted patch? On which kernel?

This machine will die in boot on these kernels until I power
cycle it (which somehow fixes the disk/controller for a
while), 2.6.18 continue to work (gets the scsi errors and
continues)
