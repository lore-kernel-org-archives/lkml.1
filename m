I vaguely recall that the behavior of when a write error _does_ occur is to 
remount the filesystem read only?  (Is this VFS or per-fs?)

Is there any kind of hotplug event associated with this?

I'm aware write errors shouldn't happen, and by the time they do it's too late 
to gracefully handle them, and all we can do is fail.  So how do we fail?

Somebody corrected me, it's not "the next" it's "the surrounding".

(Writes aren't always cleanly at the start of an erase block, so critical data 
_before_ what you touch is endangered too.)

These days instead of "atomic" it's better to think in terms of "barriers".  
Requesting a flush blocks until all the data written _before_ that point has 
made it to disk.  This wait may be arbitrarily long on a busy system with lots 
of disk transactions happening in parallel (perhaps because Firefox decided to 
garbage collect and is spending the next 30 seconds swapping itself back in to 
do so).

And here we're talking about ext2.  Does neither one know about write 
barriers, or does this just apply to ext2?  (What about ext4?)

Also I remember a historical problem that not all disks honor write barriers, 
because actual data integrity makes for horrible benchmark numbers.  Dunno how 
current that is with SATA, Alan Cox would probably know.
