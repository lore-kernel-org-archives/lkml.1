I've just released the 2.6.23-rc9-ext4-1.  It collapses some patches in
preparation for pushing them to Linus, and adds some of cleanup patches
that had been incorporated into Andrew's broken-out-2007-10-01-04-09
series.  It also has some new development patches in the unstable (not
yet ready to push to mainline) portion of the patch series.

It's available in the standard place:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4.git 2.6.23-rc9-ext4-1
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4.git;a=summary

and
