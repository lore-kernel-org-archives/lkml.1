I've seen that only once, so far.  Jiri seems to be able to trigger it more often.

I always have CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC set.

Well, I thought about that too.  However, I had a hang before 2.6.25-git2 that
I suspect was related (I couldn't get any information from the box, as it just
hung solid), so I'd rather suspect some x86 changes.

It seems to be specific to x86-64, AFAICS.

I'm not sure.
