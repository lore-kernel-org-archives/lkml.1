OK Now I see isd200_ata_command() is called from a usb.c internal thread.

What I need to do is call scsi_get_command(scsi_device*) on first invocation.
Now for the call to scsi_put_command()? At the time of the call to 
isd200_free_info_ptrs() do you think I still have a valid scsi_device at this point?

What I will do is this. I will resend my original patch with your comments
fixed. This is for the 2.6.25-rc. And I will send another patch that uses
the proper scsi_get/put_command() for testing and inclusion into the 2.6.26 kernel.
Please ACK on the patch

How are they unnecessary? who will free them? other wise they will only be
freed at the very end. And that is only because usb_stor_transparent_scsi_command()
does not need any us->extra of it's own. But if ever it will, then this code
buried here will become a leak.

And I disagree. with your solution. The module that did the allocation should
do the freeing. The above is just an example of what happens with bad programing
style. the core should not have attempted a free on a void pointer just so
protocols can get lazy and not register a destructor. Other wise we do not
learn from passed mistakes and keep doing the same errors. The free should
always be at same file right next to the alloc. (And don't get me started
on the flexibility that enables)

I keep the patch as it is, I recommend to commit it for solving the leak.

The important sense_buffer bugfix is posted as reply to this mail
