Yes, that needs re-work. Peter Zijlstra had detailed review comments for the patch

Yes, we need more documentation

We need more accurate utime/stime per cgroup. Summing them in user space is
insufficient, since tasks can move across groups and what we have is accumulated
time per task.

We thought of summing up stuff in user space, we've look harder. The plan is to
finally send all the data using cgroupstats.

The statistics was added as a part of git commit
d52aa412d43827033a8e2ce4415ef6e8f8d53635. I'll go ahead and try to document
them. These patches piggy back on the statistics patches and add pagein/pageout
counts, which is a useful statistic for the memory controller.
