/sys/class? It already has scsi_device, scsi_disk, scsi_generic and 
scsi_host.

All the above sysfs layout reflects internal SCST objects:

1. targets/target_driver_name and drivers/target_driver_name -> struct 
scst_tgt_template

2. targets/target_driver_name/target -> struct scst_tgt

3. targets/target_driver_name/target/sessions/session -> struct scst_session

4. targets/target_driver_name/target/ini_groups/group -> struct 
scst_acg. (For targets/target_driver_name/target/luns each struct 
scst_tgt would have internal struct scst_acg.)

5. 
targets/target_driver_name/target/ini_groups/group/initiators/initiator 
-> struct scst_acn

6. targets/target_driver_name/target/ini_groups/group/luns/lun and 
targets/target_driver_name/target/luns/lun -> struct scst_acg_dev

7. devices/device -> struct scst_device

8. drivers/dev_handler_name -> struct scst_dev_type

9. sgv/pool -> struct sgv_pool

So, we should simply add kobjects in them. To manipulate with then 
already there is an API, used by procfs, and should be also used by 
sysfs. This API is completely out of scst_proc.c


LAYOUT UPDATE.

Looks like it would be better to move entries from 
drivers/target_driver_name to targets/target_driver_name to keep all the 
related entries in one place. Then to reflect new state rename drivers/ 
to back_drivers/.

Thanks,
Vlad
