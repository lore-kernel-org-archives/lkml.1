yes, but my point is that the proposed behaviour is really quite bad.

We will attempt to allocate the disk space and then we will return failure,
having consumed all the disk space and having partially and uselessly
populated an unknown amount of the file.

Userspace could presumably repair the mess in most situations by truncating
the file back again.  The kernel cannot do that because there might be live
data in amongst there.

So we'd need to either keep track of which blocks were newly-allocated and
then free them all again on the error path (doesn't work right across
commit+crash+recovery) or we could later use the space-reservation scheme which
delayed allocation will need to introduce.

Or we could decide to live with the above IMO-crappy behaviour.
