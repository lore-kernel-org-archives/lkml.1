It still doesn't build:

block/cfq-iosched.c: In function ?cfq_dispatch_requests?:
block/cfq-iosched.c:1345: error: ?max_delay? undeclared (first use in
this function)

After shutting down the computer yesterday, I was thinking a bit about
this issue and how to solve it without incurring too much delay. If we
add a stricter control of the depth, that may help. So instead of
allowing up to max_quantum (or larger) depths, only allow gradual build
up of that the farther we get away from a dispatch from the sync IO
queues. For example, when switching to an async or seeky sync queue,
initially allow just 1 in flight. For the next round, if there still
hasn't been sync activity, allow 2, then 4, etc. If we see sync IO queue
again, immediately drop to 1.

It could tie in with (or partly replace) the overload feature. The key
to good latency and decent throughput is knowing when to allow queue
build up and when not to.
