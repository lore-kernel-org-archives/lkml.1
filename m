Even better.

I had this little todo on my list to change that to i_datasize and
retest.  But I think you're right, the rbtree isn't worth it at all.
Btrfs needs it for different reasons, and I just had it stuck in my head
when I copied the code over.

I'll redo the patch without the rbtree.  It won't change most of the
things that make the patch complex (the orphan handling and these
truncate interactions), but it'll definitely be nicer.

When we're going down to zero, we don't need it.  The i_disksize gets
updated again by ext3_truncate.  I'll toss in a special case for that
before the write_and_wait.
