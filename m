  Hmm, I don't get one thing:
  The call chain is invalidate_inode_pages2_range() ->
invalidate_complete_page2() -> try_to_release_page() -> ext3_releasepage()
-> journal_try_to_free_buffers() -> __journal_try_to_free_buffer() and this
function should remove the buffer from the committing transaction. So who's
holding the reference to those buffers? Or is it that
__journal_try_to_free_buffer() fails to remove the buffer from the
committing transaction? Why?
  Hmm, maybe I have one idea - in theory we could call
__journal_try_to_free_buffer() exactly at the moment commit code inspects
the buffer. Then we'd release the buffer from the transaction but
try_to_free_buffers() would fail because of elevated b_count exactly as you
described. Could you maybe verify this? Not that I'd know how to easily fix
this ;)...
