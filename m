  Indeed it does, and indeed tso was on by default.  I booted up once
after first trying this, thinking I had things set to apply it
automatically, but hadn't and ran into the exact same problem.  This 2nd
time around with the setting definitely applied things appear to be
working normally.  At least I can actually start Firefox up and have it
work (lots of /home/users/... access over NFS to the server).
