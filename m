Caring about metadata consistency and not data is just weird, I'm
sorry.  I can't imagine anyone who actually *cares* about what they
have stored, whether it's digital photographs of child taking a first
step, or their thesis research, caring about more about the metadata
than the data.  Giving advice that pretends that most users have that
priority is Just Wrong.

That's why what we should document is that people should avoid broken
storage devices, and advice on how to use RAID properly.  At the end
of the day, getting people to switch from ext2 to ext3 on some
misguided notion that this way, they'll know when their metadata is
safe (at least in the power failure case; but not the system hangs and
you have to reboot case), and getting them to ignore the question of
why are they using a broken storage device in the first place, is
Documentation malpractice.
