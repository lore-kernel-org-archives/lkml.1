change this to say 'degraded MD RAID 4/5/6 arrays'

also find out if DM RAID 4/5/6 arrays suffer the same problem (I strongly 
suspect that they do)

then you need to add a note that if the array becomes degraded before a 
scrub cycle happens previously hidden damage (that would have been 
repaired by the scrub) can surface.

this is true of all devices

re-word this something like

In addition to the standard risk of corrupting the blocks being written at 
the time of the power failure, additonal blocks (in the same flash 
eraseblock or raid stripe) may also be corrupted.
