I believe Appendix A only applies for straight up counter-mode aes,
ccm_base and rfc4309 actually have well-defined counter operations.
We've already got self-tests for ccm(aes) and a pending patch for
rfc4309(ccm(aes), and since they don't start w/'ctr(aes', they
wouldn't be caught by that (admittedly hacky) check even if we
didn't have test vectors for them.

Yeah, I thought about a flag too, but it seemed potentially a lot of
overhead for what might well be restricted to ctr(aes*). It might've
been relevant for ctr(des3_ede) or ctr(des), but they're not on the
fips approved algo/mode list, so I took the easy way out. I'm game to
go the flag route if need be though.
