The problem is that it has large hidden costs as pointed out. So while
it might be easy for you it's not a cheap operation for the whole development
process.

No, they would have ended in tree too eventually and caused the same problem.

How about if you're looking for simple work for a few hours you just
send an email to l-k and ask if someone has an idea for something? 
I'm sure you'll get suggestions. Probably more than you can take.

e.g. from the top of my hat what would be useful:

- Go through Documentation/* files and check if the options etc. described
in there are still in the code

That will actually require you to find code in the source tree and understand
it at least a little bit which are both very useful skills in general.

- Or check for kerneldoc comments that do not appear in the kerneldoc output
(because the files are missing in the DocBook templates) 

- Or build the kernel and check for any "deprecated" warnings and fix them
[perhaps not 100% trivial, but should be doable by studying other code 
a bit -- i expect that people who attempt to write such patches have at least
some knowledge of programming and C so that should be possible]

Yes, the best way to get guidance is to ask.
