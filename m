Here are actual results - the tests were still running when
I replied yesterday.

Again, this is Seagate ST3250620AS "desktop" drive, 7200RPM,
16Mb cache, 250Gb capacity.  The tests were performed with
queue depth = 64 (on mptsas), drive write cache is turned
off.

Sure thing.  I guess I'll set up a web page with all
the results so far, in a hope someday it will be more
complete (we don't have many different drives to test,
but others do).

By the way.  Both SATA drives we have are single-platter
ones (with 500Gb models they've 2 platters, and 750Gb
ones are with 3 platters), while all SCSI drives I
tested have more than one platters.  Maybe this is
yet another reason for NCQ failing.

And another note.  I heard somewhere that Seagate for
one prohibits publishing of tests like this, however
I haven't signed any NDAs and somesuch when purchased
their drives in a nearest computer store... ;)

Oh well, I see.... :(
