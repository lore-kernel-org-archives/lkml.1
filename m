The drive is the second member of RAID1 array, as far as I understand, both
drives should be experiencing very similar access patterns, and they are
the same model with the same firmware, and manufactured on the same day,
but only one of them showed these symptoms, so there must be something
"special" about it.
By now I think that MD made the right "decision" failing the drive and
removing it from the array, so I guess let's leave it at that.
