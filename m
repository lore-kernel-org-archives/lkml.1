For once that would require more live registers. It's not
a clear and obvious win. Especially not if you have
only very little registers, like on 32bit x86.

Then it would typically increase code size.

Then x86s tend to have very very fast L1 caches and
if something is not in L1 on reads then the cost of fetching
something for a read dwarfs the few cycles you can typically
get out of this.

And lastly even on a in order system stores can 
be typically queued without stalling, so it doesn't
hurt to do them early.

Also at least x86 gcc normally doesn't do scheduling 
beyond basic blocks, so any if () shuts it up.
