  Yes, my patches fix exactly this problem. So please try running with
them. I'm not sure about that HTREE corruption you see during fsck. That
seems to be a separate issue.

  Yes, this usually produces far too many messages. The soft lockup was
probably caused by the machine being too busy logging all the messages
(log files are synced which adds much more to the load of the
filesystem). I'd probably leave that aside for now and concentrate on
the corruption problem.
