Hi,

I had a bit of trouble finding some patches that were released by Andy Yan at
Marvell on November 9th, so here is a link:

1/7: http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-scsi/2009/11/9/6558753
2/7: http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-scsi/2009/11/9/6558763
3/7: http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-scsi/2009/11/9/6558773
4/7: http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-scsi/2009/11/9/6558783
5/7: http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-scsi/2009/11/9/6558793
6/7: http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-scsi/2009/11/9/6558803
7/7: http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-scsi/2009/11/9/6558813

I haven't tried these myself, but I believe that mr. Fjellstrom tried, with
success.

Note to the lists - the patches weren't properly construction for inclusion in
the kernel. If the outstanding issues could be fixed, this would be a boon to
the open-soure community as these cards are very good value for money. They
have been recommended for use on OpenSolaris by one of Stanford's ZFS
admins, which indicates their quality to be very much acceptable.
