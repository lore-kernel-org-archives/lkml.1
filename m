It doesn't seem strange to me, but then I've just been through all this.
user_*_step is about what the task will do next.  TIF_SINGLE_STEP is about
what the task has done recently.  Of course more good comments always help.
I might be inclined to change the name of TIF_SINGLE_STEP so that its true
purpose is more obvious.  

AFAICT, in fact it is not even about single-step per se.  It means some PER
trap happened and should produce SIGTRAP.  Don't you get the same thing if
you haven't used single-step, but instead used PTRACE_POKEUSR to set up
per_struct with bits that say to trigger for some other reason?

How about calling it TIF_PER_PENDING?

Right.  (This could well still change in the future.  But that's how it is
in utrace now.  And regardless of possible future implementation changes it
will always be the case that sometimes it will be called on current.)

Yes, sounds good.

I see.  Thanks for the explanation.


Thanks,
