The idea looks reasonable, but the patch above doesn't apply to Bruce's
for-2.6.27 tree. The nfsd() function has changed a bit. Actually, I
think we can make this even simpler. kthreads start with all signals
ignored and the new patch enables all of the ones in SHUTDOWN_SIGS. So
I don't think we need any signal masking at all.

How about this patch? It should apply on top of the patchset already
in Bruce's tree.

------------[snip]--------------

Subject: [PATCH] knfsd: treat all shutdown signals as equivalent

knfsd currently uses 2 signal masks when processing requests. A "loose"
mask (SHUTDOWN_SIGS) that it uses when receiving network requests, and
then a more "strict" mask (ALLOWED_SIGS, which is just SIGKILL) that it
allows when doing the actual operation on the local storage.

This is apparently unnecessarily complicated. The underlying filesystem
should be able to sanely handle a signal in the middle of an operation.
This patch removes the signal mask handling from knfsd altogether. When
knfsd is started as a kthread, all signals are ignored. It then allows
all of the signals in SHUTDOWN_SIGS. There's no need to set the mask
as well.

That looks reasonable to me, though I tend to find standard list
functions easier to follow...

The main reason I was going to add a field to the task_struct was
because I wanted to make sure that kthread_should_stop() was a quick
operation. If we can just use PF_EXITING then that's definitely a
better scheme.
