	"Ish", the 32-bitter, has been the only hard-hanger.  Since
upgrading to 2.6.24, it's crashed once, inexplicably, but has since
stayed up longer than it has since I started with the whole SATA
fiasco (which I intend to inflict upon myself again, as soon as I
get back to a "stable" config -- masochistic nature I suppose).

	The hardware drivers in ish are the older PATA drivers --
nothing new...cept I did add tickless option for system clock.
I've only been running XFS on this system (mostly same hardware,
disks upgraded), for about 6-7 years.

	Um...yeah, AND with multiple "cp's of multi-gig files
going on at same time, both local, by a sister machine via NFS,
and and a 3rd machine tapping (not banging) away via CIFS.
These were on top of normal server duties.  Whenever I stress
it on *purpose* and watch it, works fine.   GRRRRRRR....I HATE
  THAT!!!

	Uh huh...please note I'm not, trying to point fingers at
xfs_fsr, but the locking diagnostics associated with xfs_fsr have
been the only "hint" of anything "irregular", _at_ _least_, that is,
since I've removed the SATA controller+disk) on 'ish32'.

	The file system(s) going "offline" due
to xfs-detected filesystem errors has only happened *once* on
asa, the 64-bit machine.  It's a fairly new machine w/o added
hardware -- but this only happened in 2.24.0 when I added the
tickless clock option, which sure seems like a remote possibility for
causing an xfs error, but could be.  A 3rd linux system, hardware poor,
"ast-32", was up over 20 days on 2.23.14 (w/tickless) before I
took it down for a 2.24.2 kernel install (its single 20G disk is so
old that it doesn't support barriers).

	What could be the consequences of this locking anomaly?
I.e., for example, in NFS, I have enabled "allow direct I/O on NFS
files". The times when the system has been unstable would be around
the time when the local machine might be running xfs_fsr while
a remote system is using NFS to write its backups.  The exact
timing of things depends on the dump-level and internet-'book-keeping'
work done on the local system which adds an element of uncertainty
as to whether or not xfs_fsr might be running at the same time
NFS might be doing direct I/O.

It's also possible for a local backup to be writing to a backup disk
at the same time xfs_fsr is running, since they trigger off of
different cron entries (xfs_fsr off of cron.daily which runs
"whenever"), and backups which run at mostly fixed times.
The local backup uses xfs_dump (which might use some direct I/O to read?)
but the writes go through compression, and are likely using buffered
i/o.

	Is there a reason to unlock and relock the same inode while
the level 3 lock is held -- i.e. does 'unlocking ilock' allow some
increased 'throughput' for some other potential process to access
the same inode?  I'd expect not, if the 'iolock' is held, but just
a question.  I certainly don't understand the exact effects of
the various locks in question, but it seems that the 2nd two groups
where the inodes are unlocked and relocked are superfluous if
an iolock for those inodes remains held.  But again, I don't really
know what the locks are doing, so don't know.

	Sorry for all the bother. Just trying to figure out why a
system  that was rock-solid (2-3 month uptimes, easily, only planned
downs), to going all flako on me when I tried to add SATA and upgraded
kernel to include latest SATA code & drivers.  Unfortunately part of
that was adding udev in place of a static /dev, so that's another
unknown that I know is flakey at times (had a SATA sdb disk go off line
with a supposed HW-reset error, then have it come back on line as
"sdc"!)  That's certainly a bit weird from my perspective, but hey,
some might consider it a feature, so who am I to argue....:-)
