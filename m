I'd assumed the move was primarily because of the difficulty of getting
correct semantics on a shared filesystem--if you're content with
NFS-only access to your filesystem, then you can probably do everything
in userspace, but once you start worrying about getting stable
filehandles, consistent file locking, etc., from a real disk filesystem
with local users, then you require much closer cooperation from the
kernel.

And I seem to recall being told that sort of thing was the motivation
more than performance, but I wasn't there (and I haven't seen
performance comparisons).
