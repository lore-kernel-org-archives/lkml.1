That version does not bother me. I'm not worried about locks as much as
I am about recursion. If that "task_pid()" ever became a function that is
traced by mcount, then it will end up in a recursive loop, and will crash 
the system.

This may be fine.

Just so you understand what I'm concerned about:

$ objdump -dr kernel/pid.o
[...]
0000025f <find_get_pid>:
 25f:   55                      push   %ebp
 260:   89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
 262:   53                      push   %ebx
 263:   e8 fc ff ff ff          call   264 <find_get_pid+0x5>
                        264: R_386_PC32 mcount
 268:   89 c3                   mov    %eax,%ebx
 26a:   b8 01 00 00 00          mov    $0x1,%eax


looking in arch/x86/kernel/entry_32.S:

ENTRY(mcount)
        cmpl $0, function_trace_stop
        jne  ftrace_stub

        cmpl $ftrace_stub, ftrace_trace_function
        jnz trace
[...]
trace:
        pushl %eax
        pushl %ecx
        pushl %edx
        movl 0xc(%esp), %eax
        movl 0x4(%ebp), %edx
        subl $MCOUNT_INSN_SIZE, %eax

        call *ftrace_trace_function



looking in kerne/trace/ftrace.c:

                        if (ftrace_pid_trace >= 0) {
                                set_ftrace_pid_function(func);
                                func = ftrace_pid_func;
                        }
                        ftrace_trace_function = func;

And we then have

static void ftrace_pid_func(unsigned long ip, unsigned long parent_ip)
{
        if (current->pid != ftrace_pid_trace)
                return;

        ftrace_pid_function(ip, parent_ip);
}


Now by having ftrace_pid_func call find_get_pid, we have the function flow 
of...


 schedule() /* any traced function */
  --> mcount
        --> *ftrace_trace_function == ftrace_pid_func
          ftrace_pid_func
               --> find_get_pid
                    --> mcount
                         --> *ftrace_trace_function == ftrace_pid_func
                             ftrace_pid_func
                                  --> find_get_pid
                                       [ ad infinitum ]


The comparison must be very careful not to call anything that will also 
trace. I can add code to catch this recursion, but this is overhead I do 
not want to add. Remember, this is called on every function call.

If we do the work at the time we set ftrace_pid_trace and we can do simple 
pointer comparisons in the ftrace_pid_func, I will be happy with that. I'm 
still learning about this pid namespace, so I'll probably screw it up a 
few more times ;-)
