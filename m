I agree with you.

When I measured the performance of a tracer (LKST) which used conditional
branches, the overhead of the conditional branch itself was very small
(less than 1%).
Moreover, some benchmarks showed the performance of the patched kernel
became ~1% faster than before :-) (I guessed that came from changing of
memory access pattern and timing.)

I think, if someone is considering about the actual performance impacts,
we'd better discuss the effects of the individual trace points, based
on the actual results of some benchmarks.
Thus, we can improve it step by step.

Thank you,
