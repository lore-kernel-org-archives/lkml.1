the only one of these that I would find unexpected would be the one on the 
motherboard.

why is this any different from the external enclosures? they have always 
appeared as the type of device that connects them to the motherboard, (and 
even with SCSI, there are some controllers that don't generate sdX 
devices)

the driver for the controller is what has historicly determined what the 
device appears as to the system. an example of this is the 3ware driver 
that is a SCSI drive but the drives attached to the card are IDE drives. 
another example is the I2O drivers (which give you access to the Raid 
array and to the individual drives, in different namespaces). while I may 
disagree with some of the selections that have been made (the 3ware has 
always seemed odd to me for example) it's pretty simple to figure out.

but in any case, historicly IDE (PATA) and SATA drives have been handled 
differently, IDE drives have had fixed device names based on how they are 
connected, SATA devices have had 'order found' device names from the SCSI 
heritige. mixing the two types into one namespace requires changing one or 
the other. while I would love to see SATA gain hardware path dependant 
names I'm not holding my breath, but I hate to loose the predictable 
nameing (even if the names change) for the IDE drives.
