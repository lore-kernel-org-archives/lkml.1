Not putting words in James' mouth, but I definitely agree that the 
in-kernel mkfs raises a red flag or two.  mkfs.ext3 for block-based 
filesystems has direct and intimate knowledge of ext3 filesystem 
structure, and it writes that information from userland directly to the 
block(s) necessary.

Similarly, mkfs for an object-based filesystem should be issuing SCSI 
commands to the OSD device from userland, AFAICS.

That's far too complex for what is necessary.  Just issue SCSI commands 
from userland.  We don't need an abstract interface specifically for 
low-level details.  The VFS is that abstract interface; anything else 
should be low-level and purpose-built.
