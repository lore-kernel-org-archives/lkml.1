I would vote for "no", at least for nfs v3. Shutting down lockd would 
require clients to reclaim the locks. With current status (protocol, 
design, and even the implementation itself, etc), it is simply too 
disruptive. I understand current logic (i.e. shutting down nfsd but 
leaving lockd alone) is awkward but debugging multiple platforms 
(remember clients may not be on linux boxes) is very non-trivial.
