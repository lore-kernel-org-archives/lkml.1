I want to use dm-ioband even without cgroup and to make dm-ioband has
flexibility to support various type of objects.

This is because to handle cgroup on dm-ioband easily and it keeps the
code simple.

This can be solved by using a tool or a small script.

I think your approach is not bad, but I've made it my purpose to
control disk bandwidth of virtual machines by device-mapper and
dm-ioband. 
I think device-mapper is a well designed system for the following
reasons:
 - It can easily add new functions to a block device.
 - No need to muck around with the existing kernel code.
 - dm-devices are detachable. It doesn't make any effects on the
   system if a user doesn't use it.
So I think dm-ioband and your IO controller can coexist. What do you
think about it?

Could you elaborate on this? dm-ioband doesn't control it per second.
