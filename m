I think we may relax the check here and let the individual file system
decide if they support preallocation for directories or not. What do you
think ?

One thing to be thought in this case is the error code which should be
returned by the file system implementation, incase it doesn't support
preallocation for directories. Should it be -ENODEV (to match with what
posix says) , or something else (which might make more sense in this
case) ?
