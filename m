Last I recall, Greg was vehemently opposed to having direct path access
by device number in sysfs, but many other people saw benefit.

Myself (the originator), I simply decided that my sysfs access code has
to work with older kernels too, so for now I'm just doing a brute force
tree search to find things in sysfs.  I did get the code size down smaller
for it, but it's still a pain.

When the direct access feature goes in, I'll just change my code to try it first,
and then still fall back to the tree search method on failure.

Good!
