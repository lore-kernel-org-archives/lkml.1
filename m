There aren't that many commits affecting sr between 2.6.24 and 2.6.25,
so I'd bet on the previous culprits.

This time, the taxonomy looks like NOT_READY isn't being waited for
properly.  I'd still tend to blame
210ba1d1724f5c4ed87a2ab1a21ca861a915f734 it's just that this time I
suspect this to be the problem line:

	if (sshdr.sense_key == NOT_READY && sshdr.asc == 0x04)
		return CDS_DISC_OK;

Previously the code would have returned CDS_NO_DISC for the not ready
case.  The CD would have tried to close the door but (and this is the
key) it would have waited for the door to close before trying again.
