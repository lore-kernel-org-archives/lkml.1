When possible, residual should be exact because the residual amount is not bounced
and might even be zeroed-out for security, as the meaning of residual is that these bytes
are garbage.

Nothing big really, just that before (according to the comment), the theoretical
negative case would be full-residual. and now it is zero (untouched).

I know that in iscsi a negative residual is possible which means over-flow. That is:
the target had more data to give then the buffer had space for. (which is not an error at all)

Yes, there is a couple of other places that have that with the meaning of
blk_end_request_all() (Have I commented on one?). Are you doing this conversion
in these patchset? or this is for a second pass?
