That's to be expected.  These patches aren't supposed to prevent I/O 
errors, they are merely supposed to prevent the errors from continuing 
indefinitely.

And the errors did stop, so the patch did what it was supposed to do.

That's a little strange, but not unheard of.

Now that is truly bizarre.  It means that the drive responded 
differently even though it received the same sequence of commands as 
before.

> Do you wish me to test anything else?

Yes.  Please post a usbmon trace for each of the last two tests.  That 
is, with the unusual_devs update only, and with the unusual_devs update 
plus the invoke_transport update and the scsi_requeue_command update.
