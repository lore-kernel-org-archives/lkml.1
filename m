It was a very confusing use of the word thread.  I have the same number
of kernel threads running, but the single spindle on the drive has to
deal with 3 different streams of writes.  The seeks/sec portion of the
graph shows a big enough increase in seeks on the duplication run to
explain the performance.

It does, I'll give the test a shot on other hardware too.  To be honest
I'm pretty happy at matching ext4 with duplication on.  The graph shows
even writeback and the times from each iteration are fairly consistent.

Ext3 and XFS score somewhere between 10-15MB/s on the same test...
