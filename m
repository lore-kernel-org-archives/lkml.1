I know for sure that scsi has other cases. The above is a per-command
per-sense-information. Some commands might write/read some bytes and still return
CHECK-CONDITION with some sense-info+residual pertaining what was actually
executed.

See above. I know for a fact that this is not always the case, and that
it is a per command. In fact I relay on such behaviour in the osd filesystems.
If the midlayer would filter such cases for me I would have had data
corruptions.

[Read passed end of osd-object will read up to end, and return a warning
 check condition. With a choice of returning zero-bytes at invalid bytes
 or returning residual]

I do have Kernel code that relays on this. I do use bsg's SG_IO successfully
that has above behaviour.

That is: total transparency of residual count and sense information
communicated between user-code and target. Then user-code can make intelligent
decisions based on what he's done. And this is what the Kernel policy
should be. No more, no less.

Again. With some commands/subsystems these are undefined, with some
like SCSI, they are very well defined in all cases. (Even in the undefined
cases). So please keep them intact, some code might want to relay on this.

(On the undefined cases Kernel should set a policy on what is returned)

Yes, unsupported.

Since current meaning means success, actually, and there is no real extra information
that users need.
Look at it this way, until today negative meant Zero with extra information which
no one cares for.
