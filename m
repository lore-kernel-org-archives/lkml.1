the reason is simply that no other crypto modules define depends on the
listed ones:

# modinfo -F depends dm-crypt
dm-mod,crypto_blkcipher

# modinfo -F aes_generic sha256_generic cbc
crypto_algapi
crypto_hash
crypto_algapi,crypto_blkcipher

# modinfo -F crypto_blkcipher crypto_hash
crypto_algapi
crypto_algapi

and even the new modules don't depend on each other:

# modinfo -F cryptomgr
crypto_hash,crypto_algapi,crypto_blkcipher,aead,pcompress

# modinfo -F chainiv
crypto_algapi,rng,crypto_wq,crypto_blkcipher

# modinfo -F krng
rng,crypto_algapi

so the following depends should be added/changed:

- chainiv should depend o 'krng' instead of 'rng' at least
- maybe cipher modules like aes,serpent,... should depend on 'cryptomgr'
  instead of 'crypto_algapi'
- crypto_algapi should depend on chainiv

these changes are pure guesses, i don't know the details. but at least
additional depends need to be defined for crypto modules, don't you
think so?

greetings,
 jonas
