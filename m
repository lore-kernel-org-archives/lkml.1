Today I tried Knoppix 6.0.1, kernel 2.6.28.4.  aha152x_cs is a module here 
too.  When inserting a 1460, nothing happened.  Removing a 1460, nothing 
happened.  Inserting a 1460, nothing happened.  I modprobed aha152x_cs.  It 
modprobed successfully.  Removing a 1460, inserting, removing, inserting, 
nothing happened, even though the module remained loaded.  The older 
partially working kernel was better than this.

Today with Knoppix 6.0.1, kernel 2.6.28.4, this one is worse too.  Here 
aic7xxx is a module, not compiled in.  I don't remember if I had to modprobe 
it manually but I think not.  I think that inserting a 1480 automatically 
modprobed the module and it worked for the time being.  However, removing 
the card started the time bomb.  Reinsertion was no longer necessary. 
Around 20 seconds after removal, if the console was in text mode then there 
would be a 1-line crash message with no dump.  Attempts to rmmod aic7xxx 
failed.  It didn't matter if I tried 0, 1, or multiple times while the time 
bomb was running, rmmod failed and the crash was still coming.

One time I shut down Knoppix 6.0.1 from whatever KDE's Start button is 
called, the usual way of doing a shutdown, instead of letting a crash do it. 
When the CD-ROM tray popped open, I guessed that Knoppix was nearly done 
shutting down, so I hit the Enter key, and the power went off a few seconds 
later.  Older versions had some text mode messages on the screen during 
shutdown, and told us at the same time as it popped open the CD tray.  OK, 
this one isn't the fault of a SCSI driver.

Sometimes there are reasons to stick to older partially working versions.
