Yeah, it seems to be broken.

sg_break is a workaround for the hardware restrictions, I think.

As I said, I don't think that converting SCSI drivers to sg_ring (with
lots of non-trivial work) provides any benefits. Surely, sg_ring
enables us to modify sg lists but SCSI drivers don't need the
feature. What SCSI drivers needs is just a efficient way to get the
next sg entry (they use 'sg++' in the past and sg_next now).
