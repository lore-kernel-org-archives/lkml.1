Which are a trivial wrapper around wait queues.  I have patches to kill
them, but I'm not entirely sure it's worth it

nope.

Which are needed so we can have asserts about the lock state, which
generic rwsems still don't have.  At some pointer Peter looked into
it, and once we have that we can kill the wrapper.

and wrappers around kmalloc and kmem_cache.

Actually a lot of the ioctl API don't just need documentation but
a complete redo.  That's true at least for the physical device
management and subvolume / snaphot ones.
