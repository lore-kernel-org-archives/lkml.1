To be honest, not really unless the person maintaining the driver
agrees.  The reason for not doing this to obsolete drivers is that
although in theory git will remember it, trying to find a lost block of
code in git is time consuming and you often have to know where to look
for it.  Secondly, the code might be relevant to someone actually
needing to fix or use the driver.  Sometimes the code in non compiled
blocks can give valuable insights into how the driver actually worked.

Often, for dead code we don't quite know what to do with, we surround it
with #if 0/#endif blocks to make it quite clear it's not compiled, but
for nonexistent config options, that's not really necessary.

So this looks like a standard bios remapping for something ... I'd guess
a traditional mapping flag for the TekRam 1040.  Someone would likely
have to dig into history to find out what it was originally for and why
it's still here.
