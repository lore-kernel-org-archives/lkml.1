Don't do that, please. What we need to do is ensure that the model fits
with whatever the driver wants to do there, and for some drivers it's
actually a lot easier to rely on elv_next_request() returning the same
requests again instead of keeping track of it yourself. So any patch
that enforces the model that you must dequeue before starting the
request, will get a big nak from me.

What we need to do is add a 'peek' mode only, which doesn't start the
request. Along with something to mark it started that the driver can
use, or it can just use elv_next_request() of course.

Agree, for now we are ok since it's just SCSI.
