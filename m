Who what where why when?  How does this patch work?

<spends faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar too long trying to work out what WRITE_SYNC does>

ytf can't we document these things?

I'm having trouble distinguishing all that code from a pile of crap.

I mean, let's graph it:

WRITE_SYNC -> WRITE_SYNC_PLUG -> BIO_RW_SYNCIO -> bio_sync() -> REQ_RW_SYNC -> rw_is_sync() -> does something mysterious in get_request()
                                                                            -> rq_is_sync() -> does something mysterious in IO schedulers
                              -> BIO_RW_NOIDLE -> bio_noidle() -> REQ_NOIDLE -> rq_noidle() -> does something mysterious in cfq-iosched only
           -> BIO_RW_UNPLUG   -> bio_unplug() -> REQ_UNPLUG -> OK, the cognoscenti know what this is supposed to do, but it is unused!

It this really really so obvious and simple that we can afford to leave
WRITE_SYNC semantics undocumented?

All this makes it impossible to review your patch.
