  Yes, I think that checking out for JFS_ABORT is the right thing to do.
Once the journal has aborted for some reason, it is enough that we print
some error message (and that is responsibility of the first caller of
journal_abort()). Printing that checkpointing has not succeeded as well is
IMO not needed.

  Well, as I said, one flag in journal is not a big deal but I found it a
bit confusing why there's a special flag for checkpoint abort when standard
abort would do fine as well.

  Yes.

  I see. The thing I'm afraid of with this policy is, that when sometime later
we add somewhere journal_update_superblock() and forget about checking
whether journal isn't aborted, we will magically get filesystem corruption
when IO error happens and that would be really hard to debug. So I'd
rather refrain from updating j_tail and j_tail_sequence.

  "flush" means "make journal empty". If we are not able to do it all, it
does not really matter how much do we manage to write out. So I wouldn't
change the loop.
