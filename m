Yes.  Sorry.   I stopped the writer once the reader saw the NULL bytes.

I think fp.flush() in Python is equivalent to fflush() i.e. it only
flushes the stdio buffer.  It doesn't actually call fsync or fdatasync
or anything like that.

We can pretty easily change the Python code to use the syscall
write()/etc methods.

I've exported them on the server as sync e.g. in exports:

  /export		192.168.0.0/24(rw,sync)

However I don't give any special options when mounting e.e. on the
client:

  mount machine:/export  mntpnt

Anyway thanks for looking at this and let me know if I can do anything
else!
