Maybe there is an invariant that an address_space never has a dirty
page beyond the end-of-file??
Certainly 'truncate' invalidates and un-dirties such pages.

With typical writes, ->write_begin will extend EOF to include the
page, and ->write_end will mark it dirty (I think).

mmap writes are probably a bit different, but I suspect the same
principle applies.

If the page is not dirty, then 
			if (PageWriteback(page) ||
			    !clear_page_dirty_for_io(page)) {
				unlock_page(page);
				continue;
			}

will fire, and you never get to
			ret = (*writepage)(page, wbc, data);

My understanding is that memory mapping is always done in multiples of
the page size.
When you dirty any part of a page, you effectively dirty the whole
page, so you need to extend the file to cover the whole page.
i.e. the page_mkwrite() call must extend the file to a size of 4096.
