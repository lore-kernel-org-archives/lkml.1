Right, it's not.  That phrase was coined by the previous maintainer, Jean, to
describe a specific mechanism which makes for smaller code in drivers/hwmon.

Given my patch, he could also just add sysfs_create_attr_group_filtered(...).
This would affect current users even less than what you suggest because it
wouldn't bloat the struct that they all use.

Again, I don't see how it is better to bloat a struct with many users instead
of just adding a function for the few that need the extra functionality.  My
patch also requires 0 change for everyone else.

BTW: I hope you're not resisting based on the prospect of deprecating those
two functions.  I don't really have time to push such a huge patch either.
It wouldn't hurt just to keep them.

Conceptual correctness, for one, but also it allows hwmon drivers to move as
much as 1K each out of the data section and into text.  This is useful for the
embedded XIP scenario.

And please don't underestimate conceptual correctness: at least hwmon (and
probably many other users) really *rely* on the core not to modify the contents
of struct attribute_group (specifically, the data to which its members point).

Without the proper const qualifiers, this is not externally guaranteed.
