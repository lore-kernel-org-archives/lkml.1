  Hello,

  Sorry for replying a bit late but I'm currently falling behind in
maling-list reading...

  Yes.

and nobody uses it (except for the assertion in
__journal_temp_unlink_buffer()). t_outstanding_credits is supposed to be *the*
counter making sure we don't write more than we have credits for.

  But which moving and dirtying do you mean? The caller which dirties
the buffer must make sure that he has acquired enough credits for the
transaction where the buffer ends up... So if there were not enough
buffers in the running transaction where we refiled the buffer it is a
bug in the caller which dirties the buffer.

  I suppose you see the assertion J_ASSERT(journal->j_free > 1); to
fail, right? I don't see how your patch could help avoid that assertion.
You've just removed accounting of t_outstanding_credits which has no
impact on the real number of free blocks in the journal stored in
j_free. Anyway, if you can reproduce t_outstanding_credits <
t_nr_buffers, then there's something fishy. Are you able to reproduce it
also with a current kernel?
  Thanks for looking into the problem :)
