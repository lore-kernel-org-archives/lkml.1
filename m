Add helper functions "upper_32_bits" and "lower_32_bits" to 
<include/linux/kernel.h> to allow 64-bit integers to be separated into 
their 32-bit upper and lower halves without promoting integers, without 
stretching sign bits, and without generating compiler warnings when used 
with any integer not greater than 64 bits wide. High-order bits are 
assumed to be zero for integers with fewer than 64 of them. Result values 
are always 32-bit unsigned.

If the argument is 64-bit, the return value is 64-bit; otherwise, the 
return value is the same as the size of the argument. This prevents 
integer promotion. I was trying to also not promote,, say, a short int, if 
for some stupid reason somebody was using one. But you're right, a cast is 
clearer, and the functions are clearly intended for 32-bit arithmetic.

I suppose. I'm trying to be careful and account for stupid edge cases, but 
then again, such code is horribly broken so we can instead ignore them? We 
shall assume the mask gets promoted as necessary.

It enhances readability and prevents compiler warnings without increasing 
code-local complexity. Besides, if we have upper_32_bits, we should have 
lower_32_bits. Two similarly-named function calls is better than a 
function call and a mask.

And it's really nice to be able to write code that is word-size 
independent and also not cluttered. And if any code declares macros like 
this now, they can be eliminated and make a little more utility code 
central.
