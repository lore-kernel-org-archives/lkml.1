I was able to get it mostly lockdep complaint by using mutex_lock_nested
based on the level of the btree I was locking.  My allocation mutex is a
little of a problem for lockdep though.

Yes, although in general only the helper threads end up actually doing
the IO for writes.  Unfortunately, they are almost but not quite an
elevator.  It is tempting to try sorting the bios on the helper queues
etc.  But I haven't done that because it gets into starvation and other
fun.

I haven't done any real single cpu testing, it may make sense in those
workloads to checksum and submit directly in the calling context.  But
real single cpu boxes are harder to come by these days.
