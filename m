Subject: [PATCH 4/8] Kconfig: use common Kconfig for s390.
Message-ID: <20070420113330.GE3738@skybase>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline
User-Agent: Mutt/1.5.13 (2006-08-11)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Martin Schwidefsky <schwidefsky@de.ibm.com>

Disband drivers/s390/Kconfig, use the common Kconfig files. The s390
specific config options from drivers/s390/Kconfig are moved to the
respective common Kconfig files.

-	---help---
-	  A pseudo terminal (PTY) is a software device consisting of two
-	  halves: a master and a slave. The slave device behaves identical to
-	  a physical terminal; the master device is used by a process to
-	  read data from and write data to the slave, thereby emulating a
-	  terminal. Typical programs for the master side are telnet servers
-	  and xterms.
-
-	  Linux has traditionally used the BSD-like names /dev/ptyxx for
-	  masters and /dev/ttyxx for slaves of pseudo terminals. This scheme
-	  has a number of problems. The GNU C library glibc 2.1 and later,
-	  however, supports the Unix98 naming standard: in order to acquire a
-	  pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo
-	  terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo
-	  terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/<number>. What was
-	  traditionally /dev/ttyp2 will then be /dev/pts/2, for example.
-
-	  The entries in /dev/pts/ are created on the fly by a virtual
-	  file system; therefore, if you say Y here you should say Y to
-	  "/dev/pts file system for Unix98 PTYs" as well.
-
-	  If you want to say Y here, you need to have the C library glibc 2.1
-	  or later (equal to libc-6.1, check with "ls -l /lib/libc.so.*").
