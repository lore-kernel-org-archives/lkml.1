Yep, good point.  As I mentioned earlier, though, I'm about 99% sure
that the right fix is to remove all mention of s_dirt entirely, and in
fact we can make super_operations.write_super be NULL for ext3 and
ext4.  But for now we should just keep it in its usual place for now,
and save that for a cleanup commit later on.

    ext4: wait on all pending commits in ext4_sync_fs()
    
    In ext4_sync_fs, we only wait for a commit to finish if we started it,
    but there may be one already in progress which will not be synced.
    
    In the case of a data=ordered umount with pending long symlinks which
    are delayed due to a long list of other I/O on the backing block
    device, this causes the buffer associated with the long symlinks to
    not be moved to the inode dirty list in the second phase of
    fsync_super.  Then, before they can be dirtied again, kjournald exits,
    seeing the UMOUNT flag and the dirty pages are never written to the
    backing block device, causing long symlink corruption and exposing new
    or previously freed block data to userspace.
    
    To ensure all commits are synced, we flush all journal commits now
    when sync_fs'ing ext4.
