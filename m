I've verified it works empirically ... and it's behaviour a lot more
than SCSI seems to be relying on.  However, confirming and documenting
this as expected behaviour would seem to be in order.

So, relying on the behaviour, I think this is the fix for the cxgb3i: it
splits the chelsio_t3 depends off so cxgbi3 can depend on them
separately and still select the option.
