  As Miklos pointed out, there's at least call do_invalidatepage() from
block_write_full_page() which does invalidate the page but does not clear
dirty bits or remove page from page cache. Otherwise I'd agree with
you...

  Well, you definitely cannot increase file size because someone wrote to
the last page of file whose size is not multiple of page size. So when your
block size is smaller than page size, you have to handle it somehow... You
could instantiate blocks beyond end of file but that gets a bit tricky
(e.g. in ext3, we don't allow such blocks to exist so far).
