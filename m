It means that two different DMA operations will be performed against
the same dma addresss on the same device at the same time. It doesn't
happen unless there is a bug in a driver, an IOMMU or somewhere, as I
wrote in the previous mail.

Yeah, I thought about this possibility. However, you use GART IOMMU,
right (you can see "PCI-DMA: using GART IOMMU." in a boot message if
so)? If you use GART IOMMU, unmapped addresses are not reused.

Sounds like there is a leak...
