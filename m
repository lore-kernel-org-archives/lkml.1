Hello Dan,

I guess it is not clear to driver authors that they should call
dma_run_dependencies() for each dma_async_tx_descriptor that is
processed. Without a careful re-reading of this email, I would not have
known. I guess anyone reviewing the driver missed it too. Judging by the
code in other drivers, it should be called immediately after calling the
callback function. The fsldma driver doesn't even call the function at
the moment.

To the people testing fsldma with talitos: you should probably try
adding a call to dma_run_dependencies() in the fsl_chan_ld_cleanup()
function. Then run your tests again, and see if the interoperability
problems are fixed.

I'm still working through a cleanup patch series. There are some places
where the locking doesn't seem right to me, and I'll be attempting to
fix those as I go through the driver.

Ira
