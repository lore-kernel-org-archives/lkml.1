That's not a bug.

For starters, we have transport classes that provide generic store
methods but can't pass the information on to drivers.  For these, we set
the attribute to read only even if there is a store method.  Even if
that weren't the case, how do you know which of UGO wants the write
setting?  Finally, if you look at the sysfs code, the place where mode
settings of the sysfs files are handled doesn't see the show/store
methods at all (these are handled at a different layering within the
generic driver model).
