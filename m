<sigh>

You're the second person today to report a software RAID5+XFS corruption on
the 2.6.18-4 Debian kernel. Almost the same signature as well - that is a
corrupted free space btree.

The other report was a shutdown before corruption got to disk,
so maybe they are different problems.

Can you post the repair output so we can see what the damage was?
Also, can you post your md/dm config so I can see if I can recreate
a similar config?

Also, seeing as the previous report was caught before corruption
got to disk, I suspected memory corruption of some kind. Can
you enable slab, vm and filesystem debugging for you kernel and
run with that?

Cheers,

Dave.
