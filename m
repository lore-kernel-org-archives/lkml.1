Why don't we just merge the interface for preallocation (essentially
enough to satisfy posix_fallocate() and the simple XFS requirement for 
space reservation without changing file size), which there is clear agreement
on (I hope :)).  After all, this was all that we set out to do when we
started.

And leave all the dealloc/punch/hsm type features for separate future patches/
debates, those really shouldn't hold up the basic fallocate interface.
I agree with Christoph that we are just diverging too much in trying to
club those decisions here.

Dave, Andreas, Ted ?
