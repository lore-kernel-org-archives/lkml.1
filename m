hmmmmm.  Well, ATA ULD is certainly the long term goal.  My main worry 
would then be user impact & confusion, and increasing the difficulty of 
separating libata from SCSI by increasing difficulty of making SCSI 
emulation an optional piece.

At this point the SCSI emulation is not only a hack to get sd.c to do 
work for us, it is also part of the ABI expected of diagnostic tools and 
the like.  That complicates changes.

It is my hope that we can separate libata-scsi.c into a separate kernel 
module, thus at least making it _optional_, thus providing a path for 
CONFIG_ATA + !CONFIG_SCSI.

I do also agree that the ATA hacks can only go on for so long, before 
they start infecting SCSI.   e.g. there was a patch to add DMI check in 
sd.c for an ATA hardware special case.

So far the "ATA infection" has been thankfully limited to things that sd 
might need anyway, like suspend/resume (start/stop)

A "libsd" does not seem viable, though.  Might be better to
	cp sd.c ata-disk.c
and then iterate from there, over time.
