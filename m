Ok, makes sense. It looks like with the kernel_thread interface, that
the function always runs, so we're not vulnerable to this race with
that.

Possibly. I may start by just closing the races and then look and see what
can be consolidated.

Bruce just took a patchset to make it use kthreads too. I'm thinking
2.6.27 for that, presuming that we get all of these issues worked out.

I think the only thing we can reasonably do there is make sure that
the thread actually starts before allowing svc_set_num_threads to
continue.
