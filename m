Okay; I'll use your terms when conversing with you.  :-)

That's what I was trying to accomplish in the patch you said was wrong.  
It moved the call to scsi_target_reap() from
scsi_device_dev_release_usercontext() into __scsi_remove_device().  
That is, the target's count of underlying sdevs was to be decremented
whenever an sdev was removed from visibility, not when the sdev was
released.

That's how the problem should be solved.  But the details need to be 
correct, and I don't understand how they all work (as you noticed when 
reading the patch).
