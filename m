Does that matter?  The new function is semantically identical to the old 
one, and the old code will remain in place.  If there's still users in 
the old function it may take a while for them to get flushed out (and 
won't be traced in the meantime), but you have to expect some missed 
events if you're shoving any kind of dynamic marker into the code.  The 
main problem is if there's something still depending on the first 5 
bytes of the function (most likely if there's a loop head somewhere near 
the top of the function).

Updating the markers would mean you'd leave a trail of old versions 
hanging around as modules, but that's not a huge cost...

Obviously you'd only pick up new callers of the function, which would 
mean that they'd pick up the new versions of those function-local 
things.  Though you'd need to make sure that the new versions of the 
function are using the old version's static variables...

The module machinery already deals with patching paravirt and 
alternatives into loaded modules.  Your bespoke module would get dealt 
with like any other module.
