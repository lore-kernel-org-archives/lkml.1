As always, it depends :-)

If you are doing pure flush barriers, then there's no difference. Unless
you only guarantee ordering wrt previously submitted requests, in which
case you can eliminate the post flush.

If you are doing ordered tags, then just setting the ordered bit is
enough. That is different from the barrier in that we don't need a flush
of FUA bit set.

In reality maybe the difference isn't all that great, at least we can
start by having WRITE_ORDERED == WRITE_BARRIER.
