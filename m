Looks like it's trying to print a zero.  I made a diff to print out the 
raw numbers, and did indeed get zero.

Now, *why* it is printing a zero is another matter (as is why using 
ffz() instead of ilog2() there...).  Some quick investigation showed 
that sdkp->capacity is a 32-bit quantity in this configuration, and 
shifting it left by 9 of course ends up with zero; being a virtual disk, 
it's an exact power of two.

Still, it is bad that string_get_size() hangs on passing zero.

The spinlock lockup is still happening, so I'm assuming it is an 
unrelated bug that was masked by the string_get_size issue.

Patch series will follow shortly.
