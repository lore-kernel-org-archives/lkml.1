The return value in current implementation has been kept as "long" where
zero is returned for success and an error on failure. This is done to
keep it inline with posix_fallocate behavior.

This point was brought up sometime back by Badari. At that time it was
decided to keep it the way posix_fallocate is designed. Here are the
posts related to this:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/2/18
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/2/162
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/2/208

Still if you feel that we should be returning number of bytes
preallocated, we can again ask for opinion here.

Thanks!
