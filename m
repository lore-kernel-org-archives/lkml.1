There are big doubts among storage experts if features I and II are 
needed at all, see, e.g. http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/5/331. I also tend 
to agree, that for block storage on practice MC/S is not needed or, at 
least, definitely doesn't worth the effort, because:

1. It is useless for sync. untagged operation (regular reads in most 
cases over a single stream), when always there is only one command being 
executed at any time, because of the commands connection allegiance, 
which forbids transferring data for a command over multiple connections.

2. The only advantage it has over traditional OS multi-pathing is 
keeping commands execution order, but on practice at the moment there is 
no demand for this feature, because all OS'es I know don't rely on 
commands order to protect data integrity. They use other techniques, 
like queue draining. A good target should be able itself to scheduler 
coming commands for execution in the correct from performance POV order 
  and not rely for that on the commands order as they came from initiators.

 From other side, devices bonding also preserves commands execution 
order, but doesn't suffer from the connection allegiance limitation of 
MC/S, so can boost performance ever for sync untagged operations. Plus, 
it's pretty simple, easy to use and doesn't need any additional code. I 
don't have the exact numbers of MC/S vs bonding performance comparison 
(mostly, because open-iscsi doesn't support MC/S, but very curious to 
see them), but have very strong suspicious that on modern OS'es, which 
do TCP frames reorder in zero-copy manner, there shouldn't be much 
performance difference between MC/S vs bonding in the maximum possible 
throughput, but bonding should outperform MC/S a lot in case of sync 
untagged operations.

Anyway, I think features I and II, if added, would increase iSCSI-SCST 
kernel side code not more than on 5K lines, because most of the code is 
already there, the most important part which missed is fixes of locking 
problems, which almost never add a lot of code. Relating Core-iSCSI-DV, 
I'm sure iSCSI-SCST will pass it without problems among the required set 
of iSCSI features, although still there are some limitations, derived 
from IET, for instance, support for multu-PDU commands in discovery 
sessions, which isn't implemented. But for adding to iSCSI-SCST optional 
iSCSI features there should be good *practical* reasons, which at the 
moment don't exist. And unused features are bad features, because they 
overcomplicate the code and make its maintainance harder for no gain.

So, current SCST+iSCSI-SCST 36K lines + 5K new lines = 41K lines, which 
still a lot less than LIO's 63K lines. I downloaded the cleanuped 
lio-core-2.6.git tree and:

$ find lio-core-2.6/drivers/lio-core -type f -name "*.[ch]"|xargs wc
57064  156617 1548344 total

Still much bigger.

SCST and the target drivers have been successfully ran on PPC and 
Sparc64, so I don't see any reasons, why it can't be ran on Playstation 
2 as well.

The problem is that persistent reservations don't work for multiple 
initiators even for real SCSI hardware with LIO-Core/PSCSI and I clearly 
described why in the referenced e-mail. Nicholas, why don't you want to 
see it?
