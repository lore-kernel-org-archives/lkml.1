I think the refcounting is off though. For example in the shutdown case, 
if someone is accessing a scsi host sysfs attr, bfad_im_scsi_host_free 
would release the drivers refcounts on the scsi_host and free the 
im_port, but the sysfs code could still be accessing the im port. The 
shost would still be there because the sysfs code took a refcount on 
kobject/kref, but the im port is now gone. When you allocate the port 
struct in the hostdata with scsi_host_alloc this type of issue is 
handled for you.
