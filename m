All our tests with this patch enabled look good so far and comment #30 in
[1] also states that removing AAC_QUIRK_SCSI_32 for those controllers fixes
the problem.

As the original workaround was only intended to fix things on the DELL
PERCRAID, I'd be glad to see our patch being applied to disable the
workaround for our controllers again.

I didn't provide a description for the original patch yet (sorry), so
here's a suggestion:

--- SNIP ---
aacraid: disable Dell Percraid quirk on Adaptec 2200S and 2120S

A lot of 64bit machines with Adaptec 2200S and 2120S controllers don't
recognize SCSI disks any more with the patch "fix driver failure with Dell
PowerEdge Expandable RAID Controller 3/Di", but fail with tons of "aac_srb:
aac_fib_send failed with status: 8195" instead. This patch disables the
quirk introduced in the change cited above for those two controllers again.
