Yes, it protects against cpu hot-plug or hot-unplug; cpu_online_map is 
guaranteed to be unchanged while the mutex is being held.

It doesn't need to protect the per-task cpus_allowed per se, that's 
already protected.  If a task's cpu affinity changes during a call to 
set_cpus_allowed(), the migration thread will notice the change when it 
tries to deactive the task and activate it on the destination cpu.  It 
then becomes a no-op.

That's a consequence of the fact that we can't migrate current and need a 
kthread, particularly the source cpu's runqueue migration thread, to do it 
when it's scheduled.  A migration request such as that includes a 
completion variable so that the set_cpus_allowed() waits until it has 
either been migrated or changed cpu affinity again.

Right, the destination cpu will not be hot-unplugged out from underneath 
the task during migration.

Not necessarily, you can iterate through a list of tasks and change their 
cpu affinity (represented by task->cpus_allowed) by migrating them away 
while task->cpuset->cpus_allowed remains unchanged.  The hotcpu notifier 
cpuset_handle_cpuhp() will update that when necessary for cpu hot-plug or 
hot-unplug events.

So it's entirely possible that a cpu will be downed during your iteration 
of tasks, but that's fine.  Just as long as it isn't downed during the 
migration.  The cpuset's cpus_allowed will be updated by the hotcpu 
notifier and sched_hotcpu_mutex will protect from unplugged cpus around 
the set_cpus_allowed() call, which checks for intersection between your 
new cpumask and cpu_online_map.

The hotcpu notifier protects you there as well.  
common_cpu_mem_hotplug_unplug() explicitly sets them.

Same as above, except now you're using 
guarantee_online_cpus_mems_in_subtree().

It guards cpu_online_map from being changed while it's held.

It's needed to serialize with other migrations such as sched_setaffinity() 
and you can use it since all migrations will inherently need this type of 
protection.  It makes the new cpumask consistent with cpu_online_map only 
so far as that it's a subset; otherwise, set_cpus_allowed() will fail.  
The particular destination cpu is chosen as any online cpu, which we know 
won't be downed because we're holding sched_hotcpu_mutex.
