Not really, it depends on how you see it, VMware exports different IO
registers too which need to be bit banged to start some IO. So starting
an IO is not just a hypercall but a series of commands. Look at
pvscsi_kick_io, also the driver and the hypervisor code share the
request rings and completion rings which is quite similar to how a
command-queue is managed for a card. 

Also note that, the way all these things are implemented for each of the
hypervisor devices will differ and getting every hv-vendor to agree on a
common set of things is not very attractive proposition ( atleast, this
I can say from my past experiences).
