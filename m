You are dead wrong.

For RAID5 arrays, you assume that you have a hard failure and a power outage 
before you can rebuild the RAID (order of hours at full tilt).

The failure rate of S-ATA drives is at the rate of a few percentage of the 
installed base in a year. Some drives will fail faster than that (bad parts, bad 
environmental conditions, etc).

Why don't you hold all of your most precious data on that single S-ATA drive for 
five year on one box and put a second copy on a small RAID5 with ext3 for the 
same period?

Repeat experiment until you get up to something like google scale or the other 
papers on failures in national labs in the US and then we can have an informed 
discussion.

I lost a s-ata drive 24 hours after installing it in a new box. If I had MD5 
RAID5, I would not have lost any.

My point is that you fail to take into account the rate of failures of a given 
configuration and the probability of data loss given those rates.

Of course it will when you properly configure your MD RAID5.

I think that you are simply wrong.

As Ted (who wrote fsck for ext*) said, you will lose data in both.  Your 
argument is not based on fact.

You need to actually prove your point, not just state it as fact.
