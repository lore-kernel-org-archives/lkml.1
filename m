Boaz is correct. Many enterprise SCSI subsystems (FC, SAS) do not have 
hard transport addresses for each device like Parallel SCSI used to.  
Thus, any difference in order of appearance of the devices (power-up 
ordering, FC ALPA assignment based on who's loop master, order that 
switch reports them, is an array in a failover mode with 1 controller 
non-existent), or if LUN configuration on an array changes, or as a 
drive may fail (especially with hundreds), there's no guarantee you will 
see the same thing in the same order w/o name binding. Same thing is 
true if one of those adapters fails or is swapped out.

Because its the only safe way to ensure proper device identification.
