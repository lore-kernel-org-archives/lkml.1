Never mind, I was confused when I wrote this; I somehow thought we
were setting ordered mode on a per queue basis, instead of on a
per-buffer-head basis.

Also, looking more closely on the jbd2 implementation, it looks like
using the async_commit option, which relies on the checksum for more
efficient commit, completely disables any barrier support.  That's
because the only place we go into ordered more is if we are writing a
synchronous journal commit.  If async journal commit is enabled, then
we don't write a barrier at all, which leaves us in potential trouble
with if data blocks end up getting reordered with respect to the
journal commit in data=ordered more.

I *think* what we need to do is to issue an empty barrier request
between the data blocks and the journal writes in data=ordered mode,
and still issue a WRITE_BARRIER request when writing the commit block,
but to not actually wait for the write to complete.  I think if we do
that, we should be safe, and hopefully by not waiting for the commit
block to complete, the performance hit shouldn't be as bad as
previously reported.
