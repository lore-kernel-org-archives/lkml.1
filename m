This style of conversion is going to cause a lot of churn --
re-architecting this function to be single-exit, then presumably when
the lock_kernel calls are pushed further down or eliminated, turning it
back into a multiple-exit function.

I suggest that for complex ioctl handlers, it be left to the maintainers
to handle, and handle it properly all at once, rather than a gradual
pushdown.

You could argue that unlocked_ioctl has been around for a long time and
people haven't made that move yet.  But there's been no pressure before
now to do so, and I think people would rather convert their own code
than have somebody else do it.
