How does knfsd use i_version?  I would think that if all it was doing
was to compare (i_version == previous_version), then locking wouldn't
really matter.  Well, theoretically, previous_version could be
0x100000000, and i_version could be 0x1ffffffff, knfsd checks the high
word, then ext4 updates i_version to 0x200000000, then knfsd checks the
low word, detecting no change.  How likely is this?  (I don't understand
why i_version even needs to be 64 bits in the first place.)

How does knfsd protect itself from the inode changing after i_version is
checked?  Is any locking being done otherwise?
