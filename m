  OK, I admit I didn't realize mmap() has so weak requirements. Doing mmap
after ftruncate() should work fine because before you write via that new
mmap page_mkwrite() will be called anyway.
  So what we could alternatively do is that we just discard dirty bits from
buffers that don't have underlying blocks allocated. That would satisfy the
specification as well. But I have to say I'm a bit afraid of discarding
dirty bits like that. Also we'd have to handle the case where someone does
mremap() after ftruncate().
  What other memory management people think?
