Depends on your definition of "punch".

Punch means different things to different people. To me (and probably
most XFS aware ppl) punch implies no change to the file size.

i.e. anyone curently using XFS_IOC_UNRESVSP will expect punching
holes to leave the file size unchanged. This is the behaviour I
described for FA_DEALLOCATE.

That's an "unwritten-to-hole" extent conversion. Is that really
useful for anything? That's easily implemented with FIEMAP
and FA_DEALLOCATE.

Anyway, because we can't agree on a single pair of flags:

	FA_ALLOCATE        == posix_fallocate()
	FA_DEALLOCATE      == unwritten-to-hole ???
	FA_RESV_SPACE      == XFS_IOC_RESVSP64
	FA_UNRESV_SPACE    == XFS_IOC_UNRESVSP64

i.e:

#define FA_ALLOCATE	0
#define FA_DEALLOCATE	FA_FL_DEALLOC
#define FA_RESV_SPACE	FA_FL_KEEP_SIZE
#define FA_UNRESV_SPACE	FA_FL_DEALLOC | FA_FL_KEEP_SIZE | FA_FL_DEL_DATA

It would suffice for the simpler operations, I think, but we'll
rapidly run out of flags and we'll still need another interface
for doing complex stuff.....

To be useful it needs to __u64.

Right. I'd say on error you need to FA_DEALLOCATE to ensure any space
allocated was freed back up. That way the error handling in the allocate
functions is much simpler (i.e. no need to undo there).

Cheers,

Dave.
