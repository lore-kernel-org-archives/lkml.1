And while fsck is running, some other program runs that uses
memory and blows your carefully calculated paramters to smithereens?

I think there is a clear need for applications to be able to
register a callback from the kernel to indicate that the machine as
a whole is running out of memory and that the application should
trim it's caches to reduce memory utilisation.

Perhaps instead of swapping immediately, a SIGLOWMEM could be sent
to a processes that aren't masking the signal followed by a short
grace period to allow the processes to free up some memory before
swapping out pages from that process?

With this sort of feedback, the fsck process can scale back it's
readahead and remove cached info that is not critical to what it
is currently doing and thereby prevent readahead thrashing as
memory usage of the fsck process itself grows.

Another example where this could be useful is to tell browsers to
release some of their cache rather than having the VM swap it out.

IMO, a scheme like this will be far more reliable than trying to
guess what the optimal settings are going to be over the whole
lifetime of a process....

Cheers,

Dave.
