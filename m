Well, we already had this argument on linux-scsi when the interface was
first proposed:  Apart from select being very nasty and should only be
sparingly used, this interface is really only provided for specific OS
defined cases.  It's users are expected to know the pitfalls and the
dangers (it's only for boards with no fw in either pre-test or embedded
situations), so the casual user should never have to use it.

Even if I changed it to select, a user could still defeat it by making
CONFIG_SCSI_AIC94XX=y (because now the initialisation is before early
boot userland, so the request always fails).
