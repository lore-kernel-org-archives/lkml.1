Actually, I'd just like something far more basic: forcing a thin
provisioned array to support all of the three possible mechanisms.  It's
going to be a real mess trying to work out for any given array do you
support UNMAP or WRITE SAME(16) or WRITE SAME(32)?  We can only do this
currently by trying the commands ... then we have to have support for
all three built into sd just in case ... and we get precisely the same
functionality in each case ...
