Yes, but apart from that, if I remember Jamal Hadi's initial comments
on taskstats, he recommended that we align everything to 64 bit so
that the data is well aligned for 64 bit systems. You could also consider
creating a data structure, document it's members, align them and use
that to send out the data.

It would nice for you to use the versioning feature.

We could have a pre-allocated buffer stored at startup and use that for
OOM notification. In the case of container OOM, we are likely to have
free global memory. Working towards an infrastructure so that anybody can
build on top of it and sending notifications on interesting events becomes
easier would be nice. We can reuse code that way and add fewer bugs :-)
