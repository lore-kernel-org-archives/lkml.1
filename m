Ok I'll resubmit those to tytso/ext4-devel (or perhaps he has already seen 
them)

JFS and CIFS are already taken care of by the maintainers. This leaves
remote_llseek which touches a couple of file systems. Could you
perhaps take that one only please? And perhaps Nick's minix 
patchkit which looks safe to me and is unlikely to cause conflicts.

True. I am still conservative because group_add is a lot of code
which I didn't fully check. But with the open fd it's likely safe
to not take the BKL because there is nothing else (except
readdir?) in ext* that takes it.

I'll resubmit ->fasync_unlocked against -mm.

Also I wanted to recheck the ->f_flags locking. I found one bug in those 
already and I can extract the bug fix for that one.
