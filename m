Ok, that's useless. The whole point is that everybody gives different - 
but still constant - arguments.

.. and forced inlining is what we default to. But that's when "let's try 
letting gcc optimize this" fails. And macros get really unreadable, really 
quickly.

Well, actually we did. It's that "inline" there. That's how things used to 
work. It's like "no". It means "no". It doesn't mean "yes, I really want 
to s*ck your d*ck, but I'm just screaming no at the top of my lungs 
because I think I should do so".

See?

And you do have to realize that Linux has been using gcc for a _loong_ 
while. You can talk all you want about how "inline" is just a hint, but 
the fact is, it didn't use to be. gcc people _made_ it so, and are having 
a damn hard time admitting that it's causing problems.

Oh, I can well believe it. 

And I don't even think that kernel people get it right nearly enough, but 
since for the kernel it can even be a _correctness_ issue, at least if we 
get it wrong, everybody sees it.

When _some_ compiler versions get it wrong, it's a disaster.

If you can really tell that they are that small, yes.

A large portion of that has gone away now that everybody uses ccache. And 
if you only did it for functions that we _mark_ inline, it wouldn't even 
be true. Because those are the ones that presumably really should be 
inlined.

So no, I don't believe you. You much too easily dismiss the fact that 
we've explicitly marked these functions for inlining, and then you say 
"but we were too stupid".

If you cannot afford to do the real job, then trust the user. Don't guess.
