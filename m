No I will not, it is true. exofs is just a regular old filesystem
nothing different.

The ULD belongs to scsi but the library could sit else where, how
is that an argument?

Nicely is a matter of opinion. I think that building a bio in stages
in the background, then at the point of execution build a request-from-bio
and execute is a nice design that makes sure nothing is duplicated, copied,
and wheels are not re-invented. Current Kernel design is nice, why change
it?

Not true, show me where? You keep saying that. Where in the code is it
reinvented?

That, above is exactly a re-invention of block layer. What was all that
scatterlist pointers and scsi_execute_async() cleanup that you worked
so hard to get rid off. It was a list of pages+offsets+lengths, that's what
it was. Now you ask me to do the same, keep an external structure of
pages+offsets+lengths. pass them three layers down and at some point in
time force new block_layer interfaces, which do not fully exist today,
to prepare a request for submission.

No! the decision was, keep preparation of request local and submit it
in place, without intermediate structures. From-memory-to-request
in one stage.

That's what I want. The bio lets me do that yesterday, lots of file
systems do that yesterday.

All I'm asking for is one small blk_make_request() that is a parallel
of generic_make_request() of the BLOCK_FS, for the BLOCK_PC requests

If someone wanted a filesystem over tape drives, over st.c or osst.c.
He would design it similar. collect bios in background, point and shoot.
The blk_map_xxx functions where made to satisfy user-mode interfaces, for
filesystems it was bio for ages.

I don't know about you, but me, I don't have to do some work to know
it's bad. I can imagine before hand that it is bad. I usually run
hundreds of simulations in my head, discarding any bad options until I
find the one way I like. Usually the short easiest way is also the best.
(Since I'm very lazy)
Like with bidi for example, Why not just take two requests instead of
one? But I was sent to do all that gigantic work so everyone will see
that.

It's not that big and long evolution. It is a simple:

struct request *blk_make_request(struct bio*, gfp_t gfp);

And we are done. more simple then that? I don't know
