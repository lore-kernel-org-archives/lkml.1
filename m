That's good news ... at least we know where the issue lies; now the
problem comes: there are two candidate patches for this issue: Alan's
driver update patch and Tomo's accessors patch.  Unfortunately, due to
merge conflicts the two are pretty hopelessly intertwined.  I think I
already spotted one bug in the accessor conversion, so I'll look at that
again.  Alan's also going to acquire an inito board and retest his
conversions.

I'm afraid it might be a while before we have anything for you to test.
