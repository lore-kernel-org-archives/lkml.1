Thanks a lot for this.
Rather than checking the file size in read_page, I would like to make
sure the 'count' that is passed in never exceeds the size of the
file.  This should have the same effect.

So this is that patch I plan to submit.

Thanks again,

------------------
Avoid reading past the end of a bitmap file.

In most cases we check the size of the bitmap file before
reading data from it.  However when reading the superblock,
we always read the first PAGE_SIZE bytes, which might not 
always be appropriate.  So limit that read to the size of the
file if appropriate.

Also, we get the count of available bytes wrong in one place,
so that too can read past the end of the file.
