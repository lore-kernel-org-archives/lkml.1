I don't have an objection with removing this, but does anyone have the
latest version of akpm's buffer debugging patches?

I *think* what happened is that akpm forward ported the removed buffer
debugging patches, or maybe rewrote it from scratch, but for whatever
reason they never made back into mainline.  Maybe they were too ugly
to live in mainline, but they have been really handy on occasion.
