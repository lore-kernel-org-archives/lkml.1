Yes. I have been discussing all of these with Mingming. I agree with you
that it looks silly to update all the places to not hold a ref on the
buffer while waiting for spinlocks. 

Adding a launder_page() seems to be the right approach. I wouldn't worry
about making O_DIRECT slower. Currently, its failing with -EIO in this
case anyway. 

Unfortunately, this happens at a customer site and I can't effort to
give them a complete re-write type patch - I need to get this into 
older distro release :( Thats why I am trying to fix the cases.
I am finding more and more of these ..

Thanks,
Badari
