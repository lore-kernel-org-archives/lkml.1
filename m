That's what I address with the last paragraph of the email.

You get zero instructions and five bytes of NOP in the non-taken case.

In the taken case, you move the whole thing out of line.

"Rather more flexible?"  Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman?  There is no 
difference, none, nada.

Furthermore, your capture stub compiler, or trace data extractor, can do 
any kind of mapping it pleases; so I'm utterly confused what you're 
talking about "still tied to variable names."
