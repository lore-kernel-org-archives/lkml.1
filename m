The response size of SMP DISCOVER keeps growing with
each rev. Currently in SAS-2 revision 12 it is 112 bytes long!
The original SAS standard and SAS 1.1 have implicit response
sizes and for DISCOVER that is 56 bytes.

To be compliant with SAS-2 the code should read byte 3 of
a DISCOVER response. If it is zero then the response length
is 56 bytes, otherwise the response length is that many
dwords (i.e. 4 byte units) plus 4 bytes for the CRC.
[Similar logic applies to many other SMP responses.]

I have tables for all SMP requests and response (up until
SAS-2 rev 12) in my smp_utils package, see the smp_lib.c
file.
