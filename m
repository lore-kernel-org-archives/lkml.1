It wasn't previously possible for servers to expose symlinks in the
mount path to clients, so it's not clear to me how to apply precedent.

I certainly agree that mount shouldn't do a bind mount in that case.

The question doesn't arise with NFSv2/v3, since the mount protocol can't
return a symlink to the client.

Exactly, it can't--that's what worries me.  Under your proposal, the
server will return symlinks to the client which the client will
sometimes interpret relative to the server namespace, and sometimes
relative to the client namespace.

Since the server can't know which the client will do, I don't see how to
make any sensible decision about what the value of that symlink should
be.

In your example, if the intention of creating /bar/baz/symlink was
really to direct clients mounting that path to mount /bar/foo, I wonder
if the most helpful thing might just be for the server to return
a filehandle for the directory /bar/foo/ instead of for the symlink
/bar/foo/symlink.

Again, I don't understand how v2/v3 precedent applies here.

In any case, I think this is a subtle argument, and something that other
client implementers will come across, hence worth documenting on the
ietf list.
