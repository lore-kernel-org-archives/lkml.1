So we have sunk to this level now, snip and edit citing?

I'm about to leave, so I wont comment on the above. But the below is
basically what we pretend right now, and I think that is perfectly fine.
If you go and reconfigure your device and it suddenly doesn't support
barriers anymore, call the doctor and tell him that your foot hurts when
you slam it in the door. Don't do that, it's pretty simple. We already
agreed to kill the -EOPNOTSUPP and just pretend it always works, with a
notifier that we MAY not be safe. Not much point in harping the same
thing over and over again.
