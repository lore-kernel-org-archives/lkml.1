this is the point of disagreement. the devices you can trivially enumerate 
can be handled easily and trivially, the ones that you can't may require 
more complex things to handle them, but that depends on the situation. If 
you only have one USB drive on a system you don't need to worry about what 
order USB hotplug events come in if you can just say 'the first USB 
drive'. mixing the different types of devices into one namespace 
complicates things in a couple of ways.

1. devices that used to have stable names no longer have stable names 
without extra effort.

2. having multiple seperate unstable namespaces with one name in each of 
them looks to the user like a stable namespace, since the instability 
never comes into play. combineing these into a single namespace looses 
this stability

yes, this changed. If you run your IDE drives with the PATA drivers of 
libata they show up as sdX, and are subject to the same detection order 
issues as any other sd device.

does it have to be one or the other? /dev/hda1 suceeded on both metrics.

but is the possibility of wanting different options really sufficiant 
reason to eliminate every stable option? right now the /dev names are 
essentially random without external help. why couldn't they be stable (in 
all cases where that is possible) and let people who are happy with the 
defaults not run the external helpers, but leave them as options for 
people who do want things to be different.

this would still require spinning up every drive and looking at it to find 
the UUID.

maby it's becouse I've been useing linux for so long (since before 1.0), 
but I have not been seeing the same thing, it's possible that none of the 
several hundred servers I've built and managed have been big enough to 
have the problems that you describe, but the recent 'fixes' for these 
problems have been more painful for me than the original problems.

yes I have had kernel upgrades that changed the link order of drivers and 
I've had to deal with that, but I still have that problem today, with udev 
and friends involved. I recently was installing linux onto machines with 
multiple SCSI controllers and had all sorts of fun becouse the install 
disk detection order wasn't the same as the installed kernel detection 
order, causing the installer to decide teh wrong drive was the boot drive 
and put the boot loader in the wrong place (and this happened for multiple 
distros). To get things working I finally did the install, then dug up my 
old slackware boot disks to get into the system and manually install the 
boot loader to fix things up.

I've also had problems with distro boot systems not working with labels
becouse there were too many drives in the system and it gave up before 
checking far enough to find the root partition (on that machine the root 
partition was sdr2)

but there's a huge difference between a distro deciding to not include UP 
kernels and removing the option to build a UP kernel from the kernel 
entirely. Nobody is saying that Ubuntu (or any other distro) should be 
prohibited from makeing everything SMP, or i686, we are just saying that 
the option to compile something UP or i486 should not be removed just 
becouse distros don't choose to use them much. (has the i386 option been 
completely erradicated yet? or is it still hanging on)
