I'm not sure it's worth it either.

It's down to:

typedef struct mutex mutex_t;

but it's still there.

Good to know.  Rather like btrfs's wrappers around mutexes then ...

XFS still has 'fs/xfs/linux-2.6'.  It's a little bigger than compat.h,
for sure, and doesn't contain code for supporting different Linux
versions, sure.  But it's still a compat layer.

That's a more important critique than Andi's.  Let's take care of that.

I don't think that's as true of btrfs as it was of XFS -- for example,
Chris has no incentive to keep compatibility with IRIX, or continue to
support CXFS.  I don't think 'getting included in kernel' is Chris'
goal, so much as it is a step towards making btrfs better.
