I agree it is a problem. It's a bit hard to pass down a gfp_mask
(because the caller would normally expect _all_ operations in the
called code to obey the mask, basically impossible to do for
GFP_NOFS because by definition we're calling into ->write_begin).

I was leaning towards adding a new AOP_FLAG_ there, usable just by
filesystem code, and just to tell any helper code to clear __GFP_FS.
That way callers won't get confused into thinking they can do
GFP_ATOMIC writes from interrupt context or something ;) (which,
trust me, somebody will attempt to do if it looks remotely feasible!)
