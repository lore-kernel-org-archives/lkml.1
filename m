Example I seen went like this:

Drive in raid 5 failed; hot spare was available (no idea about
UPS). System apparently locked up trying to talk to the failed drive,
or maybe admin just was not patient enough, so he just powercycled the
array. He lost the array.

So while most people will not agressively powercycle the RAID array,
drive failure still provokes little tested error paths, and getting
unclean shutdown is quite easy in such case.
