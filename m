That's fine with me.  I just followed the example of e.g. arch_ptrace_attach.

I haven't reviewed that whole set in detail yet.  So I'd rather leave this
for a later cleanup.  (This ptrace change alone, along with its ia64
pieces, can probably go in much earlier without disrupting anything else.)

The fatal_signal_pending function in that patch is not exactly the same as
this check, though it might turn out that it's actually equivalent due to
higher-level constraints.  


Thanks,
Roland
