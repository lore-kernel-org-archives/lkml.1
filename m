With the latest mainline all the reports I get look like real leaks but
some of them are pretty difficult to debug. I have a kmemleak
development tree as well which, among other things like more
cond_resched() calls, scans all the task stacks (currently using
for_each_process) but it doesn't reduce the number of reports.

Yes. It's also easy to identify recent commits causing leaks but
currently it looks like some of the have been around for some time
(though probably not so serious leaks).
