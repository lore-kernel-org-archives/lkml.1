>From the patch description of the kernel message catalog script:

The kmsg check is invoked with "make D=1" and reads the source files for
all objects that are built by the current configuration and searches for
matching kmsg descriptions for the kmsg messages in the source which
have a messages id > 0. If a message description can not be found the
script prints a blueprint and causes a make error.

The kmsg catalog script if called with "make D=1" will check all the
messages in the current build. When a message is introduced you have to
pick a free number. The checking is done automatically and errors will
be caught without trouble.

Ok, fair enough.

NO! The message nor the message tag should change if the message
semantically still reports the same thing. If the meaning of the message
changes then change the message AND the message tag.

The actual name is not really important, but if the name is choosen
wisely it does convey information. Guess what "dasd.17" tells you
something about the dasd driver, "zfcp.42" about the zfcp driver and so
on. The code structure should not dictate how the message tag is
created.
