If the page gets cleaned after page_mkwrite and before the page
table locks are taken again in order to set the pte writeable.
(actually, page_mkclean only runs if it finds mapcount elevated,
so it is enough to clean the page even after the locks are taken
and before mapcount is incremented in the case of __do_fault).
