I have no idea if this will make any difference for the problem you're
seeing, but it has been submitted and it's worth trying out.  If the
problem still occurs, I'll write a diagnostic patch to add log messages
giving the destiny of each request in scsi_io_completion().

Alan Stern




This patch (as1144c) removes scsi_end_request().  The routine had only
one caller, so it is moved inline and simplified.

In addition, if no forward progress has been made then the patch
decrements a request's retry counter before unpreparing and requeuing
it, to avoid infinite retry loops.
