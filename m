I don't think anybody has even thought about the shmmax default in
years.  Sure, it might be time to reexamine that.

It would be useful to get distro input on this.  Do they override the
kernel default at boot time?  If so, what do they do?


Also, from a quick read it looks to me that shmmax is busted in the
non-init namespace.

clone_ipc_ns() calls shm_init_ns() which does

	ns->shm_ctlmax = SHMMAX;

which a) fails to inherit the parent's setting and b) cannot be altered
from SHMMAX via the sysctl?
