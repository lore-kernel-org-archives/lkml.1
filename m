Early versions checked capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN), and we reasoned that we
would later attempt to remove the need for privilege so that all users
could safely use it.

Arnd Bergmann called us on that nonsense, pointing out that it'd make
more sense to let unprivileged users use them now, so that we'll be
more careful about the security as patches roll in.

So, Oren's patchset right now only checkpoints current, despite pid
being part of the API.  So the task can access its own data.  When
the patch supports checkpointing another task (which Oren says he's
doing right now), then our intent is to check for ptrace access to
the target task.  (Right, Oren?)

> What happens if I pass it a pid which isn't system-wide unique?

pid must be checked in the caller's pid namespace.  So if I've create a
container which I want to checkpoint, pid 1 in that pidns will be, say,
3497 in my pid_ns, and so 3497 is the pid I must use.  If I try to pass
1, I'll try to checkpoint my own container.  And, if I'm not privileged
and init is owned by root, the ptrace() check I mentioned above will
return -EPERM.

I would assume that do_checkpoint() would return -EINVAL, but it's a
great question:  Oren, did you have another plan?

Not in the caller's pid_namespace.

Yes, all of the file opens and mmaps must not skip the usual security
checks.  The task credentials are currently unsupported, meaning that
euid, etc, come from the caller, not the checkpoint image.  When the
restoration of credentials becomes supported, then definately the
caller (of sys_restore())'s ability to setresuid/setresgid to those
values must be checked.

So that's why we don't want CAP_SYS_ADMIN required up-front.  That way
we will be forced to more carefully review each of those features.

Right, some of the above should be spelled out somewhere.  Should it be
in the patch description, in the Documentation/checkpoint.txt file,
or someplace else?  Oren, do you want to filter the above information
into the right place, or do you want me to do it and send you a patch?
