Hi,

>  >  Does the exception happen every time?

Well, I just got the kernel to boot all the way with both 2.6.24.3 and
2.6.20 accidentally by changing the FC host side settings on all the
target infortrend eonstor RAID boxes to point-to-point from loop. All
the targets and initiators are connected to a QLogic 5600 FC switch
and zones have been setup such that the initiators can see only the
targets. This active zoning has not changed during testing.

At the time I was actually testing the eonstor boxes outside the FC
switch by connecting them directly to another Apple Xserve running OS
X, which is using the same LSI FC HBA that I reported in my first post
regarding this issue. After testing that each target (LUN) could be
seen by the LSI FC HBA in the OSX Xserve, I reconnected the targets
back into the switch. Since the Linux Xserve was endlessly rebooting
itself after each kernel panic, to my surprise I had found that it
completed booting! All targets and LUNs can be seen under "cat
/proc/scsi/scsi".

To confirm that the loop host side setting was causing the problem, I
set one of the eonstor's back to loop and reset it. Immediately after
the eonstor came up it caused a kernel panic on the Linux Xserve
(which was already booted into the OS). This was the output on the
console:

 <0>Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt
 <0>Rebooting in 180 seconds..

I set the FC host side connection back to point-to-point and the Linux
Xserve was again able to boot into the OS. In any case, don't think
this is normal because the OSX XServe doesn't panic if it sees targets
set to loop.

Thanks,
Sabuj Pattanayek
