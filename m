Yeah, sorry about that (and to everyone receiving this thread, I'm
really sorry.  I won't do it again).  I've already been yelled at for
that.  What happened is that on a previous series I was yelled at for
not sending all patches to everyone (so that the patches could be
reviewed in context).  So, naturally, I made sure to include everyone
on the whole series this time....  doh.

Next time I post I'll constrain it to small chunks.

Thanks for the review.
