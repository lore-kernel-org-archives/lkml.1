Ok, I personally agree on that, but I think it's something to be documented.

This is good, however tuning will not be an easy task (at least, in my
experience with BFQ it has been a problem): while for throughput usually
there are tradeoffs, as soon as a queue/group idles and then timeouts,
from the fairness perspective the results soon become almost random
(i.e., depending on the rate of successful anticipations, but in the
common case they are unpredictable)...
