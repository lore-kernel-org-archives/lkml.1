The btrfs timelines have always been aggressive, and as btrfs gets
closer to feature complete, the testing matrix grows dramatically.  I
can't promise my crazy timelines won't slip, but I've been hacking away
in the basement for almost 18 months now and it's time for me to get off
the pot and make it stable.

Ext4 has always had to deal with the ghost of ext3.  Both from a
compatibility point of view and everyone's expectations of stability.  I
believe that most of us underestimated how difficult it would be to move
ext4 forward.

Btrfs is different for lots of reasons, and being in mainline will
definitely increase the pressure on the btrfs developers to finish, and
the resources available for us to finish with.

People want btrfs for different reasons.  I want btrfs in the kernel
because when you're in the kernel more people look at it, and when
people look at it they send me email with the mistakes they found.

For example, see the streaming write patches I sent to fsdevel last
week.  I wouldn't test against ext4 as often if I had to hunt down
external repos just to get something consistent with the current
development kernels.  ext4 in mainline makes it much easier for me to
kick the tires.

For ext4 at least, the mainline code is very usable.  I hope to have
btrfs in shape for that by the 2.6.29 merge cycle.
