NACK.

Now you have moved the inaccurate documentation about journalling file systems 
into the MD documentation.

Repeat after me:

(1) partial writes to a RAID stripe (with or without file systems, with or 
without journals) create an invalid stripe

(2) partial writes can be prevented in most cases by running with write cache 
disabled or working barriers

(3) fsck can (for journalling fs or non journalling fs) detect and fix your file 
system. It won't give you back the data in that stripe, but you will get the 
rest of your metadata and data back and usable.

You don't need MD in the picture to test this - take fsfuzzer or just dd and 
zero out a RAID stripe width of data from a file system. If you hit data blocks, 
your fsck (for ext2) or mount (for any journalling fs) will not see an error. If 
metadata, fsck in both cases when run will try to fix it as best as it can.

Also note that partial writes (similar to torn writes) can happen for multiple 
reasons on non-RAID systems and leave the same kind of damage.

Side note, proposing a half sketched out "fix" for partial stripe writes in 
documentation is not productive. Much better to submit a fully thought out 
proposal or actual patches to demonstrate the issue.

Rob, you should really try to take a few disks, build a working MD RAID5 group 
and test your ideas. Try it with and without the write cache enabled.

Measure and report, say after 20 power losses, how  files integrity and fsck 
repairs were impacted.

Try the same with ext2 and ext3.

Ric
