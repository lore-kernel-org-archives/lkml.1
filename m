Sorry, no offence intended. I meant today in the light of
better options.

I totally agree. At the time it was made it was the most
advance IO concept in the kernel. And it served as an example
of what should be done. Look how long it took to replace it.

There was a time around 2.6.17 or so, when it was made
to go over block-layer, and it became just a translation from
sglist to a bio. That was the time when it started to be a layering
violation and started to hurt. But it took so long to clean all
users and put things in order.

So now when people start missing it again, I use harsh words, just to
make a technical stand. I never meant it in the historical sense, at
the time and context it was written it was brilliant.

I do that today, have 3-4 outstanding async SG_IO in flight before
starting to wait on the first buffers fifo-style, Good sized requests
give you very good balance, of preparing the next buffers while previous
buffers are doing IO. So the disk is kept busy and all processing and
io preparation is done in parallel. I found that calculating sizes in
time units gives best results. Like 1/3 second for a cycle, that is 100-80
milliseconds per request.
