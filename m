Just a note, my patches do not change the BIOS behavior on reboot, thus
power is still being cut if it was so before applying the patches. But
it stops the disks first so those do not suffer from the power cut.

The variant for IDE-GD is on its way for inclusion, for the SD one I
don't know.

Below is a sample patch to add your system to the list, please check if
it works when applied on top of my 2 patches. If it doesn't you will
have to adjust the name of your laptop's manufacturer and it's product
name to correctly match your system. Please report if it works (or what
manufacturer/product name it works with) for you.
The right information can be extracted from dmidecode (System
Information block)


Tejun suggested eventually stopping the disks for all machines though
as far as I can see here my laptop is the only one affected out of a
dozen different boxes I have around. (eventually just doing it for
laptops might be reasonable as generalization)

sd, ide-gd: stop disk on reboot for Benq JoyBook S32

Ciprian Craciun reported that Benq JoyBook S32 was affected by
the same power-cut on reboot as Acer TravelMate 660, so add it
to the list.
