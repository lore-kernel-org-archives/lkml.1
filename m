You are right.

But, we still need to "standardize" (and limit) the error codes
which we should return from kernel when we want to fall back on the
library implementation. The posix_fallocate() library function will have
to look for a set of errors from fallocate() system call, upon receiving
which it will do preallocation from user level; or else, it will return
success/error-code returned by the system call to the user.

I think we can make it fall back to library implementation of fallocate,
whenever posix_fallocate() receives any of the following errors from
fallocate() system call:

1. ENOSYS
2. EOPNOTSUPP
3. ENOTTY        (?)

Now the question is - should we limit the set of errors for this purpose
to just 1 & 2 above ? In that case I will need to change the error being
returned here to -EOPNOTSUPP (from current -ENOTTY).
