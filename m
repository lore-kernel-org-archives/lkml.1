thanks for your help and please tell me, if I can do anything. We have this 
problem on a production system, but the node in question will be rebooted in 
Thursday (ups needs to be replaced). If there are some tests/reboots/whatever 
I could do, it would be best to do it shortly after the scheduled reboot.

Actually I now would have attempted to port your mod15 patch 
(http://home-tj.org/wiki/index.php/Sil_m15w#Patches) to 2.6.23, hoping it 
would solve Soerens problem and ours as well (ours magically already went 
away using the mod15 fix). Well, maybe I port it anyway to 2.6.23 to see if 
it also solves our problem.


Thanks,
Bernd
