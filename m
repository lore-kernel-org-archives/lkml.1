I don't think we should care. If we provide a syscall with the
semantics of "allocate from offset to offset+len" then glibc's
implementation can turn negative length into two separate
fallocate syscalls....

No - right now empty blocks are pruned from the directory immediately so I
don't think we really have a concept of empty blocks in the btree structure.
dir2 is bloody complex, so adding preallocation is probably not going to
be simple to do.

It's not high on my list to add, either, because we can typically avoid the
worst case directory fragmentation by using larger directory block sizes
(e.g. 16k instead of the default 4k on a 4k block size fs).

IIRC directory preallocation has been talked about more for ext3/4....

Cheers,

Dave.
