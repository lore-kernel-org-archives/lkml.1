This is with current git as of this morning, which is at v2.6.30-rc2.

I have a 1.5TB USB device which gets a bit angry when I plug it in.  It
ends up with a scsi_disk->capacity of ffffffffaea87b30.  I tracked it
down to the lba calculation in read_capacity_10():

	lba =	(buffer[0] << 24) | (buffer[1] << 16) |
 		(buffer[2] << 8) | buffer[3];

lba is getting all 0xf's in its high 32 bits.  It seems odd that this
would happen since 'buffer' is an 'unsigned char', but that is
apparently what is going on.  Note that this isn't an issue 32-bit
kernels compiled with CONFIG_LBD=n since there's no more bits into which
the sign could be extended.

The attached one-liner seems to make my system happier.  

Before patch (with a bit of my added debugging):
