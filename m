You guys are getting this wrong.
The patch from Jaswinder needs to be fixed so we unconditionally
include <asm/types.h> from linux/types.h.
And then ll users can safely include linux/types.h and when we one
day realize we can move some stuff used in .S files from
asm/types.h to linux/types.h then we are all safe and no breakage.

the rule of thum is to include the linux/* variant if the same
file exist in both linus/ and asm/ and types.h is in no way different
here

And trying to make it different just becasue it is used in userspace
intensively is just stupid and will be a cause of misunderstandings.
