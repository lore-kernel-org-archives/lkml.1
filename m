I am just starting to review suka's patches it is a subtle area and tricky.
My signal related patches were aimed at just going through the global list
of processes.

Agreed.

yes, getting the kthread API up to snuff works.

Yes. I sent a patch for review that fixes just this one aspect and
I will see what happens.

Yes.  We need to get the pid in the pid namespace that remove the
credentials.  Not the pid in the pid namespace that places the credentials
on the socket.

As for scary and delicate I agree.  We really need to pass the struct
pid, not a pid_t in the credentials.

No. autofs compiles builds and works in a single pid namespace.
The issues with multiple pid namespaces have not been fully
addresses, and autofs4 is in worse shape.  Unless there
are pending petches I'm not aware of.

Partly it may be Pavel's shift from my intent of having
pid_nr be the pid_t in current->nsproxy->pid_namespace.
To calling that function pid_vnr, and having pid_nr be
the pid_t value in init_pid_ns.

Well the point is not to use the pid_t for anything except passing to user
space.  It isn't that I object to people using __session directly it
is that I object to people using task_session_nr because it hides
possible bugs.  When we work with pids using struct pid pointers it is
clear we can't get it wrong.  When we use pid_t values it is quite
easy to get things wrong.  As the current autofs code demonstrates.

Yes. I know he was looking at it.

Which sounds completely bass akwards.  We want the option so we can
disable things now, when everything is immature, and not really
doing the right thing.  I guess I really should look in Andrews queue
and see what didn't make it, and see if there are pieces that fixes
bugs that really should have.

I think the CONFIG_NAMESPACES work was focused primarily on size
reduction under CONFIG_EMBEDDED.  Which means from a correctness
perspective I don't care.
