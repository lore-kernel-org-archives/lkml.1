Definitely.  Everything in our control we can work around.... there are
a few applications we cannot easily change... see the follow-up in
another e-mail.

Definitely.  This is a single writer, single reader case though.

Yup.

Yup.  We're definitely not asking for anything like that.

Yeah I was looking at that while debugging.  Would that change have
chance to make it into mainline?  I assume it makes the normal writeout
path more expensive, by forcing a scan of the entire address space.

Also, I should test this, but I thought the VM was calling
nfs_writepages directly i.e. not going through nfs_write_mapping.  Let
me test with this patch.
