No, but they can warn that data consistency isn't guarenteed. And they
all do, if you mount with barriers enabled and the barrier write fails.
If barriers aren't support, the first one will fail. So either they do
lazy detect, or they do a trial barrier write at mount time.

So yes, I suppose that file systems will use this error. Because that is
what they do.

Your theory is nice, but most dm systems use write back caching. Any
desktop uses write back caching. Only higher end disks default to
write-through caching.

And my point is that this case isn't interesting, because most setups
don't guarantee proper ordering. The error handling is complex, no doubt
about that. But the trial barrier test is pretty trivial and even could
be easily abstracted out. If a later barrier write fails, then that's
really no different than if a normal write fails. Error handling is not
easy in that case.
