We need rid of stray pages. Obviously dirty ones that would cause write
errors at some point need to be killed.  The danger ones are read only
ones that can hang around for a long time.  The (perhaps unlikely)
scenario where they bite is if the disk is shrunk then expanded it's one
of those annoying scenarios that most people don't care about: expanded
space is empty, what does it matter if we get stray data; and security
people jump up and down and scream about data leaking.

Yes ... force the filesystem to have errors immediately before it sees
them on writeback or read ahead or something delayed.
