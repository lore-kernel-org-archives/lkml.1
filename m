Yes. But we are talking initial creation here.

I do understand the problem and I'm not trying to trivialise it :)

I _suggested_ that it's worth thinking about things rather than jumping in to 
say "oh, we can code up a clever algorithm that keeps track of what stripes have 
valid parity and which don't and we can optimise the read/copy/write for valid 
stripes and use the raid6 type read-all/write-all for invalid stripes and then 
we can write a bit extra on the check code to set the bitmaps......"

Phew - and that lets us run the array at semi-degraded performance (raid6-like) 
for 3 days rather than either waiting before we put it into production or 
running it very slowly.
Now we run this system for 3 years and we saved 3 days - hmmm IS IT WORTH IT?

What happens in those 3 years when we have a disk fail? The solution doesn't 
apply then - it's 3 days to rebuild - like it or not.

I am not saying you are wrong.
I ask merely if the balance of benefit outweighs the balance of complexity.

If the benefit were 24x7 then sure - eg using hardware assist in the raid calcs 
- very useful indeed.

That's a simplistic summary.
You *can* loosely couple the layers. But you can enrich the interface and 
tightly couple them too - XFS is capable (I guess) of understanding md more 
fully than say ext2.
XFS would still work on a less 'talkative' block device where performance wasn't 
as important (USB flash maybe, dunno).

Agreed.

I agree there is room for improvement.
I suggest that it may be more fruitful to write a tool called "raid5prepare"
that writes zeroes/ones as appropriate to all component devices and then you can 
use --assume-clean without concern. That could look to see if the devices are 
scsi or whatever and take advantage of the hyperfast block writes that can be done.
