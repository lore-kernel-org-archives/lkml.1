It depends on the migration. The cost is proportional to the number of
pages moved. The cost can be brought down (I do have a  design on
paper  -- from long long ago), where moving mm's will reduce the cost
of migration, but it adds an additional dereference in the common
path.

Kamezawa has also wanted the page migration feature and we've agreed
to provide a per-cgroup flag to decide to turn migration on/off. I
would not mind refactoring memcontrol.c if that can help the IO
controller and if you want migration, force the migration flag to on
and warn the user if they try to turn it off.
