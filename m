There are several compelling reasons to allocate memory in UIO core.
1)
I have a requirement to *dynamically* allocate the DMA regions.
The statically mapped regions contain a variable-sized ring buffer.
I use UIO driver to allocate several thousand 4k DMA regions.
If I need more during program execution I can grow the ring-buffer.

The existing infrastructure requires that you decide at driver-stub registration
how many mappings needed, period.  Yes, we could add a flag to determine that
some mappings are to be allocated for DMA, but this does not facilitate the
*dynamic* allocation that is required.

(You and others are absolutely correct that if I only required static DMA maps
that could be gracefully handled in the driver stub and mapped 'traditionally',
but that is not the case here).

2)
Given that I need to add dynamic DMA allocation it seemed best to reuse as
much of the memory region-finding and mapping code in the UIO core.  Had I
written the whole thing in the driver stub I would have to implement another
userspace <-> kernel communication mechanism and I'd have to copy and paste
a lot of the UIO cores mmap functionality and would lose the default handling
of the traditional static mappings.

3)
By implementing this in the UIO core other folks who need such capability in
the future can do so without duplicating this effort.

4)
I'm using the same driver stub to control several different 'devices', not all
of which have DMA.  These devices can change configuration on the fly via FPGA
download.  I am trying to keep as much of the device logic in userspace
as possible.

Yes, 100 is overkill.  I'm using 2 bars with potentially 20 mappings
each to logically
separate functionality.  I got 100 by scaling this to more 5 BARs.
But 40 would be sufficient for my purposes.

Would you agree the 'best' way to do this would be eliminate the
static list, pass in a size,
and use the linked-list-based search for both DMA and static maps.

As commented above, the driver stub does not actually determine how much
DMA memory is required.

The 'normal' way to use the the DMA region is to call mmap with the magic number
and just go ahead and use the returned region.  The beauty of overloading mmap
is you get immediate O(1) access to the memory.  If memory were statically
mapped by the driver stub one would have to search for each region.

You can still use the search-for-index technique but this is O(N^2) and won't
scale well to the thousands of regions I need.  You'd only need to access the
sysfs and do the search-by-index approach if you needed multiple processes to
access the same DMA region.  (For example, a debug process or command
line tool).

Exporting this might prove useful to other driver-stub writers and this is
a valid suggestion, but exporting this isn't sufficient
