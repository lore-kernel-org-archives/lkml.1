James, this is the last time *ever* I apply patches from you after -rc1.

You used to have serious problems with the merge window, but for a few 
releases you then seemed to "get it" and got on with the program.

But now it's back to "anythign goes", apparently. And I'm going to take a 
hard-line approach with you now. 

For SCSI merges, if I don't get the first pull request in the FIRST week 
of the merge window, don't bother sending one later, unless it's pure 
fixes and regressions.

And after -rc1, I don't want to see crap like this:

	 46 files changed, 2837 insertions(+), 2050 deletions(-)

because that simply is *not* appropriate after -rc1, much less -rc2.

So I pulled, but I wanted to make it very clear that I'm very unhappy with 
you right now, and you're on my shit-list for the next few releases. Get 
the changes in before -rc1, or just *wait*. If they aren't ready before 
the merge window opens, they simply shouldn't be merged at all.
