If the server is repeatedly returning ESTALE, then the pathname
resolution will fail to make progress and give up, return ENOENT
to the user level.

A malicious user on the network can cause so many other problems
than just something like this too.  But, in this case, the user
would have to predict why and when the client was issuing a
specific operation and know whether or not to return ESTALE.
This seems quite far fetched and quite unlikely to me.

No, it doesn't and I, and most everyone else, would also like to
see such a solution.  That said, I am pretty sure that we are not
going to get a fix for ext3 and forcing everyone to move away from
ext3 is not a good solution either.

These aren't asked seriously, are they?

When possible, we get the server bug fixed.  When not possible,
such as the time stamp issue with ext3, we attempt work around
it as best as possible.

When would not retrying the MKDIR be the right thing to do?
When doing a mkdir("a/b"), the user can not tell nor cares
which instance of directory "a" is the one that gets "b" created
in it.

Which cases are the ones that you see that require user
level recovery?

Since the NFS client supports "intr", then why not continue to
retry the request?  It certainly won't hurt the network, trying
at most once every acdirmin timeout seconds.  This, by default,
would be once every 30 seconds.

This would alleviate a long standing complaint that when an
admin uses a poor administrative procedure that users become
completely hosed.

Yes.  Why not?  Please describe more specifically why you think
that it should not.

    Thanx...
