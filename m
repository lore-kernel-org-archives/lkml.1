Yes, this was the problem, at least for me.  As soon as there were
unsuccessful anticipations there was no graceful degradation of
fairness, and bandwidth distribution became almost random.  In
this situation all the complexity of CFQ/BFQ/io-controller seems
overkill; NCQ+SSD is or will be quite a common usage scenario
triggering it.

Unfortunately I am not aware of any reasonable and working method to
properly handle this issue; anyway adjusting the tunable is something
that needs a lot of care.
