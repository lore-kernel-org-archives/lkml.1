That's NULL information.

OF COURSE the root cause is the async code. We know that. We're looking 
for the specifics.

In particular, before that commit, at most you will wait for too _much_. 
In other words, it's a "good" wait. 

Your commit caused it to wait for less, and that then showed a bug. Not 
all that surprising - it's now not waiting enough.

You tried to avoid a deadlock situation of waiting for too much, but you 
avoided the deadlock by now waiting for too little. 

I also think that your code is simply buggy. As far as I can tell, int he 
case of having both running and pending events, you'll always pick the 
pending cookie. But it's the _running_ cookie that has the lower event 
number, isn't it?

I dunno. It all looks very fishy to me.
