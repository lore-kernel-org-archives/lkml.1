I hate to get into these discussions, but I've used "journaled" a lot,
so I feel I should chime in.

Maybe it's different in the UK, but I've always understood that if the
accent is not on the last syllable, then you do not double the final
vowel: offer, offered.  So if we accept the use of "journal" as a verb,
"journaled" would be correct.  

Since it's not a real word, I'd be happy not to make a big deal out of
it and accept either, so I think we're in agreement.

That would probably be more correct, but the use of "journal" as a verb
has really gotten ingrained in file system developers brains.  I
personally haven't heard or used "journalized" and it would take some
getting used to.

Shaggy

P.S. Evolution's spell-checker doesn't like "journalize" either, but I
trust that it's correct.
