I've done this when the hardware raid only suppored raid 5 but I wanted 
raid 6. I've also done it when I had enough disks to need more than one 
hardware raid card to talk to them all, but wanted one logical drive for 
the system.

most people are not willing to live with unbuffered write performance. 
they care about their data, but they also care about performance, and 
since performance is what they see on an ongong basis, they tend to care 
more about performance.

given that we don't even have barriers enabled by default on ext3 due to 
the performance hit, what makes you think that disabling buffers entirely 
is going to be acceptable to people?
