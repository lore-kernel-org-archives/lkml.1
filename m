OK, makes sense.

I'm not quite sure whether my question was answered ...

When firmware is built in, does
1) request_firmware() make a copy of it and then release_firmware free
   that copy?
2) request_firmware() return a pointer to the built-in firmware with
   release_firmware() being a no-op?
3) request_firmware() return a pointer to the built-in firmware with
   release_firmware() freeing the original?

Cases 1 and 2 are fine, case 3 is a problem.

I haven't modified the firmware at all (how could I?  ;-) since the
version in, say, 2.6.20 which was licensed under GPL or BSD.  You could
take the firmware from there under the BSD license without any legal
trouble from me.  IANAL, but this seems correct to me.
