Oops, this will cause a lot build warnings, as this struct gets
initialized like that:
        ..
        {"PNP0C0A", 0},
        ..
at a lot places. It would be better to bump up the id itself like the
attached patch does...

Thanks,

----------------------

Cross-compilation between e.g. i386 -> 64bit could break -> work around it

Adrian Bunk: scripts/mod/file2alias.c is compiled with HOSTCC and ensures that
kernel_ulong_t is correct, but it can't cope with different padding on
different architectures.
