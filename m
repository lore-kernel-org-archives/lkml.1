Ok.
In this case we may have to consider following things:

1) Obviously, for this glibc will have to call fallocate() syscall with
different arguments on s390, than other archs. I think this should be
doable and should not be an issue with glibc folks (right?).

2) we also need to see how strace behaves in this case. With little
knowledge that I have of strace, I don't think it should depend on
argument ordering of a system call on different archs (since it uses
ptrace internally and that should take care of it). But, it will be
nice if someone can confirm this.

Thanks!
