I don't see how, the rest of the code comprises of IO/MMIO  space & ring
processing which is very different in each of the implementations. What
is left is the setup and initialization code which obviously depends on
the implementation of the driver data structures.

Okay,  I think I need to take a step back here and understand what
actually are you asking for.

1. What do you mean by the "transport class abstraction" ? 
Do you mean that the way we communicate with the hypervisor needs to be
standardized ?

2. Are you saying that we should use the virtio ring mechanism to handle
our request and completion rings ? 
  We can not do that. Our backend expects that each slot on the ring is
in a particular format. Where as vring expects that each slot on the
vring is in the vring_desc format.

3. Also, the way we communicate with the hypervisor backend is that the
driver writes to our device IO registers in a particular format. The
format that we follow is to first write the command on the
COMMAND_REGISTER and then write a stream of data words in the
DATA_REGISTER, which is a normal device interface.
The reason I make this point is to highlight we are not making any
hypercalls instead we communicate with the hypervisor by writing to
IO/Memory mapped regions.  So from that perspective the driver has no
knowledge that its is talking to a software backend (aka device
emulation) instead it is very similar to how a driver talks to a silicon
device.  The backend expects things in a certain way and we cannot
really change that interface ( i.e. the ABI shared between Device driver
and Device Emulation).

So sharing code with vring or virtio is not something that works well
with our backend. The VMware PVSCSI driver is simply a virtual HBA and
shouldn't be looked at any differently.

Is their anything else that you are asking us to standardize ?
