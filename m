I was afraid of that. I don't think I want to call scsi_get_command
from within .queuecommand. I will leave the code hacked as today.

Here two, it looks like I need to introduce a new function pointer for isd200
I'll leave it for now. Though I know this is not the last I'll see of this driver.

OK so in isd200_get_inquiry_data() at the end near the call to:
			us->extra_destructor(info);
			us->extra = NULL;

It leaks the info.

Patch attached to fix the above fix

Please ACK the first patch sent, so James can put it in scsi-rc-fixes as part
of the sense_buffer effort for 2.6.25-rc

The below patch you can put threw the USB tree, it's for you.

Subject: [PATCH] isd200: Fix memory leak in isd200_get_inquiry_data

if the inquiry fails then the call to us->extra_destructor()
is assumed to also free the info structure. So make that
so in isd200_free_info_ptrs()
