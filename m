In my setups (4 & 8-way), I didn't measure any significant performance
improvements (in any reasonable workload). I see some decent
improvements on cooked-up (1 million stats) tests :(

Yes. I debated long time whether I should submit this or not - due to
very reason. Old code wasn't holding any locks. I don't have any high
count CPU machine (>8way) with me. I will request for time on one.

Noticed that too. I added WARN_ON() to see if percpu sum doesn't match
computed sum. I saw few stacks in a 24 hour run of fsx runs.
