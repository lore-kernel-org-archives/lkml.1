  Unlinked files are easy - you just don't propagate the rtime anywhere.
For hardlinks see below.

  Update of recursive mtime does not pass filesystem boundaries (i.e.
mountpoints) so bind mounts and such are non-issue (hmm, at least that was
my original idea but as I'm looking now I don't handle bind mounts properly
so that needs to be fixed). With hardlinks, you are right that the
behaviour is undeterministic - I tried to argue in the text of the mail
that this does not actually matter - there are not many hardlinks on usual
system and so the application can check hardlinked files in the old way -
i.e. look at mtime.
