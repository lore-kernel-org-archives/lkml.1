Sorry to ask the obvious question, but what would the point of all this
pain be? The existing values can't go anywhere else, so you'd have to
add symlinks back into queue/ anyway.

What crack are you smoking? :-)

A block device must have a request_queue, that's pretty much spread
throughout the kernel. The fact that md/dm is only using a subset of the
functionality is not a very good reason for re-writing large parts of
that design. We could save some space, but whether the queue is 200
bytes or 1400 bytes doesn't really make a whole lot of real-world
difference. It's not like we allocate/deallocate these all the time,
they are mostly static structures.
