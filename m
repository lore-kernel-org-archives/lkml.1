True, the application has to perform it's own read-ahead and write-back.

Kind of like how a database does it, or maybe the page cache on the
iSCSI initiator's system ;-)

That's not true, page cached I/O is broken into page sizes which limits
the I/O bandwidth of the storage hardware while imposing a higher CPU
overhead. Obviously page-cached I/O isn't ideal for all situations.

You could also have an amazing backend storage system with it's own
NVRAM cache. Why put the performance overhead onto the target system
when you can off-load it to the controller?

The bottom line which will always be true:

Know your workload, configure your storage to match.

The best storage solutions allow the implementor the most flexibility
in configuring the storage, which I think both IET and SCST do.

IET just needs to fix how it does it workload with CFQ which
somehow SCST has overcome. Of course SCST tweaks the Linux kernel to
gain some extra speed.

Vlad, how about a comparison of SCST vs IET without those kernel hooks?
