Well, no, the definition is the same in both cases:  how much data went
over the wire.  In the success case, you assume that means the device
processed it correctly.  In the failure case you need to interpret the
error (and possibly device specific knowledge) to determine what it
means.

Heh, well, this is where we get into interpretations.  For SG_IO
requests, we have three separate ways of returning error.  The error
return to the block layer, the results return and the sense code.  The
error to block is a somewhat later addition to the layer, so not all
cases are handled right or agreed (for instance we just altered BLOCK_PC
with recovered error from -EIO to no error).  So hopefully we've just
decided that deferred and current but recovered all fall into the no
error to block, but results and sense to the user.

Note that the error to block is basically discarded from SG_IO before we
return to the user, so the user *only* has results and sense to go by,
thus the concept of residual not valid on error to block is something
the user can't check.  That's why a consistent definition in all cases
(i.e. the amount of data the HBA transferred) is the correct one and
allows userspace to make the determination of what it should do based on
the returns it gets.

It's not valid bytes in either case ... it's number transferred.  One
can infer from a successful SCSI status code that number transferred ==
valid bytes, but I'd rather we didn't say that.

But that's the point ... we don't define for userland what request
failure is very well.

OK, so if what you're asking is that we can regard the residue as
invalid if SG_IO itself returns an error, then I can agree ... but not
if blk_end_request() returns error, because that error gets ignored by
SG_IO.
