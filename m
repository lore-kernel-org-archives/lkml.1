Of the bisected offending commit:

commit e261f51f25b98c213e0b3d7f2109b117d714f69d
Author: Trond Myklebust <Trond.Myklebust@netapp.com>
Date:   Tue Dec 5 00:35:41 2006 -0500

    NFS: Make nfs_updatepage() mark the page as dirty.
    
    This will ensure that we can call set_page_writeback() from within
    nfs_writepage(), which is always called with the page lock set.
    
    Signed-off-by: Trond Myklebust <Trond.Myklebust@netapp.com>


It seems to be this hunk which introduces the problem:


@@ -628,7 +667,6 @@ static struct nfs_page * nfs_update_request(struct 
nfs_open_context* ctx,
                                return ERR_PTR(error);
                        }
                        spin_unlock(&nfsi->req_lock);
-                       nfs_mark_request_dirty(new);
                        return new;
                }
                spin_unlock(&nfsi->req_lock);


If I add that function call back in... the problem disappears.  I don't
know if this just papers over the real problem though?

This commit happened between 2.6.19 and 2.6.20, btw.

Ahh, I see, that explains, why you didn't responded earlier.

Hopefully, this helps you to remember the purpose of that change.
