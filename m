You are sort of wrong.  we exposed a sysfs entry to enable sofware
controlled activity LED, then the driver was responsible for turning it
on and off. (blech, I know, but some vendors want this feature).

I understand what you are trying to do - I guess I just doubt the value
you've added by doing this.  I think that there's going to be so much
customization that system vendors will want to add, that they are going
to wind up adding a custom library regardless, so standardising those
few things won't buy us anything.
