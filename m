Ok, I have now seen "EXT3 Inode ...: orphan list check failed!" on four
separate HA pairs (8 different boxes), the other three without AOE (using
DRBD instead).  One of them has never crashed or failed over, and has had
the FS mounted since mkfs.ext3 was run.  They are running 2.6.28.7.

I will try to set up a test box and reproduce this without DRBD or AOE,
but with AOE used in one case and DRBD in another, I think the problem
may be unrelated to them.  The common pattern here is lots of I/O via
knfsd (NFSv3).

I did not see this message on kernel 2.6.27 and older kernels.
Hopefully I can get a reproducible case easily enough.  Is anyone else
seeing this error?

Simon-
