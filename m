Ok.

Could be either. Nothing so far points at a cause.

If it is relatively quick to reproduce, you could run a git bisect
to try to find the offending commit. Or when it has locked up, run
oprofile with callgraph sampling and so we can get an idea of what
is actually running when XFS appears to hang.

Not that I know of.
