    [XFS] Fix oops in xfs_file_readdir()
    
    When xfs_file_readdir() exactly fills a buffer, it can move it's index
    past the end of the buffer and dereference it even though the result of
    the dereference is never used. On some platforms this causes an oops.

    [XFS] keep i_nlink updated and use proper accessors
    
    To get the read-only bind mounts in -mm to work correctly with XFS we need
    to call the drop_nlink and inc_nlink helpers to monitor the link count.
    Add calls to these to xfs_bumplink and xfs_droplink and stop copying over
    di_nlink to i_nlink in xfs_validate_fields and vn_revalidate.

    [XFS] stop updating inode->i_blocks
    
    The VFS doesn't use i_blocks, it's only used by generic_fillattr and the
    generic quota code which XFS doesn't use. In XFS there is one use to check
    whether we have an inline or out of line sumlink, but we can replace that
    with a check of the XFS_IFINLINE inode flag.

    [XFS] Make xfs_ail_check check less by default
    
    Checking the entire AIL on every insert and remove is prohibitively
    expensive - the sustained sequntial create rate on a single disk drops
    from about 1800/s to 60/s because of this checking resulting in the
    xfslogd becoming cpu bound.
    
    By default on debug builds, only check the next and previous entries in
    the list to ensure they are ordered correctly. If you really want, define
    XFS_TRANS_DEBUG to use the old behaviour.

commit 249a8c1124653fa90f3a3afff869095a31bc229f
Author: David Chinner <dgc@sgi.com>
Date:   Tue Feb 5 12:13:32 2008 +1100

    [XFS] Move AIL pushing into it's own thread
    
    When many hundreds to thousands of threads all try to do simultaneous
    transactions and the log is in a tail-pushing situation (i.e. full), we
    can get multiple threads walking the AIL list and contending on the AIL
    lock.
    
    The AIL push is, in effect, a simple I/O dispatch algorithm complicated by
    the ordering constraints placed on it by the transaction subsystem. It
    really does not need multiple threads to push on it - even when only a
    single CPU is pushing the AIL, it can push the I/O out far faster that
    pretty much any disk subsystem can handle.
    
    So, to avoid contention problems stemming from multiple list walkers, move
    the list walk off into another thread and simply provide a "target" to
    push to. When a thread requires a push, it sets the target and wakes the
    push thread, then goes to sleep waiting for the required amount of space
    to become available in the log.
    
    This mechanism should also be a lot fairer under heavy load as the waiters
    will queue in arrival order, rather than queuing in "who completed a push
    first" order.
    
    Also, by moving the pushing to a separate thread we can do more
    effectively overload detection and prevention as we can keep context from
    loop iteration to loop iteration. That is, we can push only part of the
    list each loop and not have to loop back to the start of the list every
    time we run. This should also help by reducing the number of items we try
    to lock and/or push items that we cannot move.
    
    Note that this patch is not intended to solve the inefficiencies in the
    AIL structure and the associated issues with extremely large list
    contents. That needs to be addresses separately; parallel access would
    cause problems to any new structure as well, so I'm only aiming to isolate
    the structure from unbounded parallelism here.

    Now that all direct caller of xfs_iaccess are gone we can kill xfs_iaccess
    and xfs_access and just use generic_permission with a check_acl callback.
    This is required for the per-mount read-only patchset in -mm to work
    properly with XFS.

    xfs_swapext should simplify check if we have a writeable file descriptor
    instead of re-checking the permissions using xfs_iaccess. Add an
    additional check to refuse O_APPEND file descriptors because swapext is

    [XFS] remove permission check from xfs_change_file_space
    
    Both callers of xfs_change_file_space alreaedy do the file->f_mode &
    FMODE_WRITE check to ensure we have a file descriptor that has been opened
    for write mode, so there is no need to re-check that with xfs_iaccess.
    Especially as the later might wrongly deny it for corner cases like file
    descriptor passing through unix domain sockets.

    A problem was reported where a system panicked in log recovery due to a

    recovery definitely needs some more work in this area.

    [XFS] Remove CFORK macros and use code directly in IFORK and DFORK macros.
    
    Currently XFS_IFORK_* and XFS_DFORK* are implemented by means of
    XFS_CFORK* macros. But given that XFS_IFORK_* operates on an xfs_inode
    that embedds and xfs_icdinode_core and XFS_DFORK_* operates on an
    xfs_dinode that embedds a xfs_dinode_core one will have to do endian
    swapping while the other doesn't. Instead of having the current mess with
    the CFORK macros that have byteswapping and non-byteswapping version
    (which are inconsistantly named while we're at it) just define each family
    of the macros to stand by itself and simplify the whole matter.
    
    A few direct references to the CFORK variants were cleaned up to use IFORK
    or DFORK to make this possible.

    This assert is bogus. We can have a forced shutdown occur

    should only check XLOG_FORCED_SHUTDOWN. The logging system has it's own

    [XFS] optimize XFS_IS_REALTIME_INODE w/o realtime config
    
    Use XFS_IS_REALTIME_INODE in more places, and #define it to 0 if
    CONFIG_XFS_RT is off. This should be safe because mount checks in
    xfs_rtmount_init:
    
    so if we get mounted w/o CONFIG_XFS_RT, no realtime inodes should be
    encountered after that.
    
    Defining XFS_IS_REALTIME_INODE to 0 saves a bit of stack space,
    presumeably gcc can optimize around the various "if (0)" type checks:
    
    xfs_alloc_file_space -8 xfs_bmap_adjacent -16 xfs_bmapi -8
    xfs_bmap_rtalloc -16 xfs_bunmapi -28 xfs_free_file_space -64 xfs_imap +8

    [XFS] Fix inode allocation latency
    
    The log force added in xfs_iget_core() has been a performance issue since
    it was introduced for tight loops that allocate then unlink a single file.
    under heavy writeback, this can introduce unnecessary latency due tothe
    log I/o getting stuck behind bulk data writes.
    
    Fix this latency problem by avoinding the need for the log force by moving
    the place we mark linux inode dirty to the transaction commit rather than
    on transaction completion.
    
    This also closes a potential hole in the sync code where a linux inode is
    not dirty between the time it is modified and the time the log buffer has
    been written to disk.

    [XFS] Fix transaction overrun during writeback.
    
    Prevent transaction overrun in xfs_iomap_write_allocate() if we race with
    a truncate that overlaps the delalloc range we were planning to allocate.
    
    If we race, we may allocate into a hole and that requires block
    allocation. At this point in time we don't have a reservation for block
    allocation (apart from metadata blocks) and so allocating into a hole
    rather than a delalloc region results in overflowing the transaction block
    reservation.
    
    Fix it by only allowing a single extent to be allocated at a time.

    Sparse trips over the locking order in xlog_recover_do_efd_trans() when
    xfs_trans_delete_ail() drops the ail lock. Because the unlock is
    conditional, we need to either annotate with a "fake unlock" or change the

    Reordering the code makes it simpler, so do that.

    [XFS] Make xfs_bulkstat() to report unlinked but referenced inodes
    
    We need xfs_bulkstat() to report inode stat for inodes with link count
    zero but reference count non zero.
    
    The fix here:
    
    http://oss.sgi.com/archives/xfs/2007-09/msg00266.html
    
    changed this behavior and made xfs_bulkstat() to filter all unlinked
    inodes including those that are not destroyed yet but held by reference.
    
    The attached patch returns back to the original behavior by marking the
    on-disk inode buffer "dirty" when di_mode is cleared (at that time both
    inode link and reference counter are zero).

    [XFS] fix 32-bit compat ioctls for GETXFLAGS, SETXFLAGS, GETVERSION
    
    XFS_IOC_GETVERSION, XFS_IOC_GETXFLAGS and XFS_IOC_SETXFLAGS all take a
    "long" which changes size between 32 and 64 bit platforms.
    
    So, the ioctl cmds that come in from a 32-bit app aren't as expected, for
    example on GETXFLAGS,
    
    unknown cmd fd(3) cmd(80046601){t:'f';sz:4}
    
    due to the size mismatch.
    
    So, use instead the 32-bit version of the commands for compat ioctls, and
    other than that it doesn't take any more manipulation.
    
    Also, for both native and compat versions, just define them to the values
    as defined in fs.h

    [XFS] Refactor xfs_mountfs
    
    Refactoring xfs_mountfs() to call sub-functions for logical chunks can
    help save a bit of stack, and can make it easier to read this long
    function.
    
    The mount path is one of the longest common callchains, easily getting to
    within a few bytes of the end of a 4k stack when over lvm, quotas are
    enabled, and quotacheck must be done.
    
    With this change on top of the other stack-related changes I've sent, I
    can get xfs to survive a normal xfsqa run on 4k stacks over lvm.

    - GET_CLIENT_ID is replaced by xlog_get_client_id which leaves away
    the unused arch argument. Instead of conditional defintions
    depending on host endianess we now do an unconditional swap and shift
    then, which generates equal code.

    [XFS] cleanup vnode useage in xfs_ioctl.c
    
    xfs_ioctl.c passes around vnode pointers quite a lot, but all places
    already have the Linux inode which is identical to the vnode these days.
    Clean the code up to always use the Linux inode.

    [XFS] Kill off xfs_statvfs.
    
    We were already filling the Linux struct statfs anyway, and doing this
    trivial task directly in xfs_fs_statfs makes the code quite a bit cleaner.
    While I was at it I also moved copying attributes that don't change over
    the lifetime of the filesystem outside the superblock lock.
    
    xfs_fs_fill_super used to get the magic number and blocksize through
    xfs_statvfs, but assigning them directly is a lot cleaner and will save
    some stack space during mount.

    xfs_iocore_t is a structure embedded in xfs_inode. Except for one field it
    just duplicates fields already in xfs_inode, and there is nothing this
    abstraction buys us on XFS/Linux. This patch removes it and shrinks source
    and binary size of xfs aswell as shrinking the size of xfs_inode by 60/44
    bytes in debug/non-debug builds.

    Currently there is an indirection called ioops in the XFS data I/O path.
    Various functions are called by functions pointers, but there is no
    coherence in what this is for, and of course for XFS itself it's entirely
    unused. This patch removes it instead and significantly reduces source and
    binary size of XFS while making maintaince easier.
