(Yes, I owe you for that patch: saved me a bisect, thank you!)

Your first report had twenty oopses of this kind:
[  228.358397] BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffff88004fcXXXXX
[  228.358423] PGD 202063 PUD 8067 PMD 800000004fc03000 
whereas it should be               PMD 800000004fc001e3

Your second report had six oopses of this kind:
[19280.236437] BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffff88004fbXXXXX
[19280.236645] PGD 202063 PUD 8067 PMD 803c85370cfc01e3 
whereas it should be               PMD 800000004fa001e3

Those corrupted PMD entries are why it's crashing: not (or very unlikely
to be) a problem with ext3 or copy_page_c themselves.  But it does seem
likely that it's connected with suspend/resume.

I think I'd try editing my drivers/base/power/main.c, inserting some
tests and printks in suspend_device, suspend_device_noirq, resume_device,
resume_device_noirq (hope they're sensible places: Rafael may have better
advice).

You want to check that the unsigned long at 0xffff8800000083e8
is                                          0x800000004fa001e3
and the unsigned long at                    0xffff8800000083f0
is                                          0x800000004fc001e3
with printk of device name where it goes wrong.

Or you may find I'm wrong and those are different from the start
(changing a page attribute within a 0x200000 range would have to
break up the 0x1e3 entries: I do wonder whether a change of page
attribute might even be responsible).
