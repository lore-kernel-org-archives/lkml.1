Hi Linus,

Please pull from:

        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4.git for_linus

This patch set set contains contains bug fixes which could crashes,
performance enhancements especially for large streaming writes (thanks
to Chris Mason for pointing this out), blkdev discard support (for trim
commands for SSD's), and updates to documentation.

Note; the changes to mm/page-writeback have been reviewed by
linux-fsdevel and by Christoph Hellwig specifically.  Christoph believes
(and I agree) that we probably can get rid of the new control flag
(no_nrwrite_index_update) and make the changes in behavior of
write_cached_pages() conditionally, but that would require auditing and
updating all of the other filesystems that use that function.  So for
now we just make the change for ext4, which increases streaming write
speed to large files by a factor of five or more, so that a write to 3GB
file now proceeds at raw disk speeds.
