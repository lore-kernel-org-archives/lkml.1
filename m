I don't think it is mysterious at all.  With a HZ=100 system 1 jiffie
is 10ms, which was comparable to the seek time of a disk, so sleeping
for 1 jiffie to avoid doing 2 transactions was a win.  With a flash
device (simulated by RAM here) seek time is 1ms so waiting 10ms
isn't going to be useful if there are only 2 threads and both have
already joined the transaction.

I think both are true.  By making the sleep time dynamic it removes
the "useless" sleep time, but can also increase the sleep time if
there are many threads and the commit cost is better amortized over
more operations.
