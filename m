So you are denying all those other users that don't want to do that
the joy of checkpointing and restarting their stuff ... :(

Or, for users who do run everything in container, but some task is not
checkpointable - it is using this electronic microscope device attached
to their handheld. Alas, they do want to checkpoint that useful program
they are running there that calculates fibonacci numbers ...

Or, a nested container that shares something with the parent container,
so is not checkpointable by itself...

Ok, you probably got the idea.
