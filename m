The CC list is already big so I thought those would be monitoring

mke2fs allows to specify a 64kb blocksize and IA64 can run with 64kb 
PAGE_SIZE. So this is a bug in ext2fs that needs to be fixed regardless.

mke2fs fails for blocksizes > 64k so you are safe there. I'd like to see 
that limit lifted?

I'd love to see such a patch. That is also useful for arches that have 
PAGE_SIZE > 4kb without this patchset.
