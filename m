I don't think I can recall a linux kernel that required swap > ram.
However for serious swapping under linux having swap > ram was very
useful and pretty much a requirement for a workload that involved
swapping heavily (not thrashing).

Yes.  It may be the large amount of random access (my current guess)
or it may be something else.

I'm wonder if I should build an application with a configurable
data set and working set that can be used for swap testing.  I don't
think it would be very hard and it might help sort through some of
the swap performance problems.
