Hi

That patch with limits->max_segments = 1; is wrong. It fixes this bug 
sometimes and sometimes not.

The problem is, if someone attempts to create a bio with two vector 
entries, the first maps the last sector contained in some page and the 
second maps the first sector of the next physical page: it has one 
segment, it has size <= PAGE_SIZE, but it still may cross raid stripe and 
the raid driver will reject it.

Look at this patch, it is the proper way how to fix it: create a 
merge_bvec_fn that reject more than one biovec entry.
