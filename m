Andrew,
That was the patch to fix the sysfs symlink. You merged it and then superceded with my later patch.

--- snip -----

The patch titled
     cciss: fix sysfs regression
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     cciss-fix-sysfs-regression.patch

This patch was dropped because an updated version will be merged

The current -mm tree may be found at http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/

Actually, this looks like the right one.
