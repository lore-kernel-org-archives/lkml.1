I agree.  There is already a loop in Amit's current's patch to call
ext4_ext_get_blocks() thoug. Question is how much credit should ext4 to
ask for in each journal_start()?

I think the calculation is based on the assumption that there is only a
single extent to be inserted, which is the ideal case. But in some cases
we may end up allocating several chunk of blocks(extents) for this
single preallocation request when fs is fragmented (or part of
preallocation request is already fulfilled)

I think we should move this calculation inside the loop as well,and we
really do not need to grab the lock to calculate the credit if the @path
is always NULL, all the function does is mathmatics.

I can't think of any good way to estimate the total credits needed for
this whole preallocation request. Looked at ext4_get_block(), which is
used for DIO code to deal with large amount of block allocation. The
credit reservation is quite weak there too. The DIO_CREDIT is only
(EXT4_RESERVE_TRANS_BLOCKS + 32)

The current code handles earlier ENOSPC by three times retries. After
that if we still run out of space, then it's propably right to notify
the caller there isn't much space left.

We could extend the block reservation window size before the while loop
so we could get a lower chance to get more fragmented.

I think so. The ext4_ext_get_blocks() will end up calling
ext4_new_blocks() to do the real block allocation, quota is being
handled there, therefor is tested already.
