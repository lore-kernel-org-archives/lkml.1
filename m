Hi Linus,

Please pull from: 

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4.git ext3-latency-fixes

One of these patches fixes a performance regression caused by a64c8610,
which unplugged the write queue after every page write.  Now that Jens
added WRITE_SYNC_PLUG.the patch causes us to use it instead of
WRITE_SYNC, to avoid the implicit unplugging.  These patches also seem
to further improbve ext3 latency, especially during the "sync" command
in Linus's write-big-file-and-sync workload.

In addition, I have a patch from Jan that avoids starting a transaction
unnecessarily for the data=writepage case.

commit 430db323fae7665da721768949ade6304811c648

    ext3: Try to avoid starting a transaction in writepage for data=writepage
    
    This does the same as commit 9e80d407736161d9b8b0c5a0d44f786e44c322ea
    (avoid starting a transaction when no block allocation is needed)
    but for data=writeback mode of ext3. We also cleanup the data=ordered
    case a bit to stick to coding style...

commit 6e34eeddf7deec1444bbddab533f03f520d8458c

    block_write_full_page: switch synchronous writes to use WRITE_SYNC_PLUG
    
    Now that we have a distinction between WRITE_SYNC and WRITE_SYNC_PLUG,
    use WRITE_SYNC_PLUG in __block_write_full_page() to avoid unplugging
    the block device I/O queue between each page that gets flushed out.
    
    Otherwise, when we run sync() or fsync() and we need to write out a
    large number of pages, the block device queue will get unplugged
    between for every page that is flushed out, which will be a pretty
    serious performance regression caused by commit a64c8610.
