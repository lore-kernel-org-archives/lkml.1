Yes, but it doesn't mean we should use rw lock or rw semaphore is
preferable than plain mutex.

- the read side of subsys_mutex is mainly at mount/remount/umount,
  the write side is in cgroup_load_subsys() and cgroup_unload_subsys().
  None is in critical path.

- In most callsites, cgroup_mutex is held just after acquiring
  subsys_mutex.

So what does it gain us to use this rw_sem?

Except parse_cgroupfs_options() which is called without cgroup_mutex
held, in all other callsites, cgroup_mutex is held right after acquiring
subsys_mutex.

So yes, I don't think use cgroup_mutex will harm scalibility.

In contrast, this subsys_mutex is quite ugly and deadlock-prone.
For example, see this:

static int cgroup_remount(struct super_block *sb, int *flags, char *data)
{
	...
        lock_kernel();
        mutex_lock(&cgrp->dentry->d_inode->i_mutex);
        down_read(&subsys_mutex);
        mutex_lock(&cgroup_mutex);
	...
}

Four locks here!
