Yes, sorry "sparse"

For htree directories we can do this, because the iterate over the
directory in hash sort order, and moving the directory blocks around
doesn't change this.  For non-htree directories, you're right;
ext4_shrink_direcotry() would have to bail and not do anything if
there was a readdir() in progress for the directory in question.

Yes, that's the other way to do this; we could have an ioctl which
defrags a directory, and which will return an error if there is
another fd open on the directory (which would imply that there was a
readdir() in progress) and then do a complete defrag operation on the
directory.  It would have to be done in kernel space so the filesystem
wouldn't have to be unmounted.  Doing this all at once is more
efficient from an I/O perspective, but it's tricker to do in the
kernel because for very large directories, the method used in
e2fsck/rehash.c assumes you can allocate enough memory for all of the
directory entries all at once, which might not be true in the kernel,
since kernel memory can't be swapped or paged out.

Doing a little bit at a time means that we're O(1) in time/space for
each unlink operation.  Doing it all at once is O(n) in space, and for
very, *very* large directories that could be problematic.  It's not
impossible, but try sketching out the algorithm first.  You may find
it's more complicated than you first thought.
