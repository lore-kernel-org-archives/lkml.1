  So if just the file data cannot be read / written, you see messages
about IO errors in the log (as you see now), some application might get EIO
error but the filesystem will not be remounted. It gets remounted only if
some filesystem metadata cannot be read / written.
  It's true that retrying commands usually succeeds but not always and thus
I find it possible that eventually it fails several times in a row so that
kernel just gives up and discards data block to write because it thinks it
has no way of writing it. So I personally would ask for a warranty exchange
of the enclosure...
