Aside from Dmitry's suggestion to time sync as well (although for 10G, you are
likely not leaving much in cache) I'd ask:

What kernel version?  what xfsprogs/e2fsprogs version?

Were the filesystems created to align with raid geometry?

mkfs.xfs has done that forever; mkfs.ext4 only will do so (automatically)
with recent kernel+e2fsprogs.
