I've decided to get Ryo to post the accurate dirty-page tracking patch
for bio-cgroup, which isn't perfect yet though. The memory controller
never wants to support this tracking because migrating a page between
memory cgroups is really heavy.

I also thought enhancing the memory controller would be good enough,
but a lot of people said they wanted to control memory resource and
block I/O resource separately.
So you can create several bio-cgroup in one memory-cgroup,
or you can use bio-cgroup without memory-cgroup.

I also have a plan to implement more acurate tracking mechanism
on bio-cgroup after the memory cgroup team re-implement the infrastructure,
which won't be supported by memory-cgroup.
When a process are moved into another memory cgroup,
the pages belonging to the process don't move to the new cgroup
because migrating pages is so heavy. It's hard to find the pages
from the process and migrating pages may cause some memory pressure.
I'll implement this feature only on bio-cgroup with minimum overhead


Thanks,
Hirokazu Takahashi.
