Uniformity is certainly desirable.  But we shouldn't take it so far
as to make apples look like oranges.

We wouldn't want a SATA disk drive to have 'chunk_size' and 'raid_disks'.
Nor would we want a software RAID array to have a 'scheduler' or
'iosched' attributes.

I don't think that passing these values down is - in general - a well
defined problem.  This is (in part) because md/dm devices can be based on
partitions, and partitions don't have independent max_* values.

In your particular case, I don't expect that you use partitions, so it
makes perfect sense to do the tuning on a per-array basis.  But I
don't think that it is a concept that fits in the kernel.  As you say,
we have 'slaves/', which makes it practical to do this in user-space
and I would rather it stayed there.
