Yeah, it's a known problem.  The main problem is that we are only
checking to see merge both to the left and the right of the extent
tree when converting an extent from uninitialzied to initialized.

I've cc'ed the linux-ext4 list in the hopes someone is motivated to
fix this long-standing shortcoming.  Unless someone starts working
quickly, it's not likely it will make this upcoming merge window, but
we can hope....
