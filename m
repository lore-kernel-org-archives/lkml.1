Until 2.6.24, these drivers have taken care about the issue by
themselves. There is no change as compared with 2.6.24.

The drivers know that they use drain buffer. They can take care about
themselves on this too. If we want to do explicitly, we could have
rq->pad_len and rq->drain_len instead of rq->extra_len, though I think
that we are fine without these values because these drivers already
tell the block layer what they want and know that the block layer
gives it.


Jens, want's your verdict on this?
