I'm going from the ext4 implementation because the semantics
have not been documented yet.

IIRC, the argument for FA_ALLOCATE changing file size is that
posix_fallocate() is supposed to change the file size. I think
that having a mode for real preallocation and another for
posix_fallocate is a valid thing to do...

Note that the way XFS implements growing the file size after the
allocation is via a truncate....

That's would what I did because otherwise you'd use ftruncate64().
Without documented behaviour or an ext4 implementation, I have to
ask what it's supposed to do, though ;)

Cheers,

Dave.
