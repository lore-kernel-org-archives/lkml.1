I'm not sure what made you think that I said that.  In practice things
usually work out, as a conseuqence of the fact that ext3 uses physical
block journaling, but it's not perfect, becase...

Yes, but ext3 does not enable barriers by default (the patch has been
submitted but akpm has balked because he doesn't like the performance
degredation and doesn't believe that Chris Mason's "workload of doom"
is a common case).  Note though that it is possible for dirty blocks
to remain in the track buffer for *minutes* without being written to
spinning rust platters without a barrier.

See Chris Mason's report of this phenonmenon here:

	http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/3/30/297

Here's Chris Mason "barrier test" which will corrupt ext3 filesystems
50% of the time after a power drop if the filesystem is mounted with
barriers disabled (which is the default; use the mount option
barrier=1 to enable barriers):

	http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0805.2/1518.html

(Yes, ext4 has barriers enabled by default.)
