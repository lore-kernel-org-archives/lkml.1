The reason John & I did not add a pid field -- and we discussed it and
really wanted it -- is security. It is an information leak to know
what an unrelated process is doing.

Trust me that the rest of the kernel developers are even harder on
this subject than I.

I suppose you could fill out the pid field only if the uid's match,
but that is extra work for less utility.
