Sure!
Ingo-san. Could you apply the following patch?

Bye.

Because dma_alloc_coherent() always required DMA zone even if DMA is
NOT necessary, FUJITA Tomonori posted a patch to fix it.

http://marc.info/?l=linux-ia64&m=123314730923356&w=2

However, this fix needs one more patch to fix completely.
I tested and confirmed dma_alloc_coherent() returns 
correct zone after applied following patch.
