Matthew,

I think my last email confused you. Here are the points for submitting
this patch:

1. It is only to add the ia64 support to our driver.  This is why we add
the ia64 flag.

2. We did not change the implementation for x86 and x86_64.  The
implementation for them with u32 * is there from day one.

3. What I wanted to convey in my previous mail is that if one uses a 64
bit application (s)he may need to test for all functionality again.	

Regards.

Bo Yang

Then this patch isn't acceptable.  You need to find a way which works
for both 32-bit and 64-bit applications.

Intel are signing my paycheques ... these opinions are still mine "Bill,
look, we understand that you're interested in selling us this operating
system, but compare it to ours.  We can't possibly take such a
retrograde step."
