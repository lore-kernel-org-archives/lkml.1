No, there is no such splitting in SCST. Client sees raw SCSI disks from 
server and what client sends is directly and in full size sent by the 
server to its backstorage using regular buffered read() 
(fd->f_op->aio_read() followed by 
wait_on_retry_sync_kiocb()/wait_on_sync_kiocb() to be precise).

Thanks,
