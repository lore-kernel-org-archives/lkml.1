Um, well, you're right, it's wrong.  The reap needs to be matched with
the reap_ref++

It's hard to follow the problem without full context, but if I
understand correctly the problem is you want all the target directories
removed before you call device_del() on the host and the thing that gets
in the way is the necessary user context removal of the host.  So a
simple solution, rather than mucking with the way it works, is to wait
for the workqueues to complete.  Does this fix it?
