And here's the result (without swiotlb=65536):

DEBUG: RETURNED REQUIRED MASK ffffffff
DEBUG: SET 32 BIT ADDRESSING

(which doesn't look like a good thing, provided this
machine has 6Gb of memory...)

It just crashed again, with the same message - in a few seconds after I
mounted the filesystem in question.  So back to swiotlb=65536 ;)
