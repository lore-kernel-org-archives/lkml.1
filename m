Is the server sync or async mounted? I've seen such performance
inversion between read and write when the mount mode is async.

What is the number of nfsd threads at the server?

Which file system are you using at the server?

In iozone, are you running the read and write test during the same run
of iozone? Iozone runs read tests, after writes so that the file for
the read test exists on the server. You should try running write and
read tests in separate runs to prevent client side caching issues from
influencing raw server read(and read-ahead) performance. You can use
the -w option in iozone to prevent iozone from calling unlink on the
file after the write test has finished, so you can use the same file
in a separate read test run.

You can try building the kernel with oprofile support and use it to
measure where the client CPU is spending its time. It is possible that
client-side locking or other algorithm issues are resulting in such
low read throughput. Note, when you start oprofile profiling, use a
CPU_CYCLES count of 5000. I've observed more accurate results with
this sample size for NFS performance.

The following are not completely relevant here but just to get some
more info:
What is the raw TCP throughput that you get between the server and
client machine on this network?

You could run the tests with bare minimum number of network
elements between the server and the client to see whats the best
network performance for NFS you can extract from this server and
client machine.
