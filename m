I've released a new ext4 patchset against the 2.6.27-rc1 kernel.  This
includes a number of bug fixes reported by benchmarkers plus some
cleanups.

As before I've also released updated the patch set vs. 2.6.26 stock
kernel, for those people who don't want to play with development kernels
but who still want to test out ext4.
