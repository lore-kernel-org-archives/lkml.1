Yes, it's a bit tricky.

In reality this information is only logged when debug logging is enabled
and generally is only used by myself or others that maintain autofs. But
getting sensible logging is important so it's worth sorting this out.

I think it would be best to use the pid of the highest view namespace
which I think is the gist of what you said in the beginning. Then (at
some future time), if there was a user space API, the daemon could
report additional pid information related to subordinate pid namespaces.
I am assuming that, to be useful, an autofs daemon that is able to serve
multiple namespaces would be higher up in the tree. But the forgoing
description sounds like there's not a necessarily a hierarchic structure
to pid namespaces?

The other issue that comes up is, after storing (a reference to) the
daemon namespace in the super block info struct a "kill -9" on the
daemon would render the namespace invalid. At the moment, when this
happens the write on the kernel pipe fails causing the autofs mount to
become catatonic, but for the namespace aware case the namespace is now
invalid so we won't get that far. I could make the mount catatonic when
I detect that the namespace has become invalid but I'm not sure how to
check it. Is there a way I can to do this? Would there be any issues
with namespace (pid) reuse for such a check?

Sorry to seem so thick about this but the implications of namespaces for
autofs are quite new to me and it is important that autofs "plays well
with others" as the development progresses.

Anyway, assuming I'm on the right track I'll poke around further and see
if I can work out how I to do this.
