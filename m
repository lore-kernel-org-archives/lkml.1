Yes, I forgot that task_tgid_nr_ns() assumes ns != NULL.

I guess  __do_notify() is fine, ns_of_pid() can't be NULL.

Yes, I was going to kill them many times but always forget.

... and the code becomes more clean and simple.

I really dislike the fact that sys_kill() relies on send_signal()
(this is correct), but do_tkill() and __do_notify() play with pid ns
themselves. And this complicates send_signal() too.

Unless the kernel has a user which sends the "strange" SI_FROMUSER()
signal without ->si_pid, of course...

Oleg.
