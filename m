  Maybe before proceeding further with the discussion I'd like to
understand following: What are these user namespaces supposed to be good
for?
  I imagine it so that you have a machine and on it several virtual
machines which are sharing a filesystem (or it could be a cluster). Now you
want UIDs to be independent between these virtual machines. That's it,
right?
  Now to continue the example: Alice has UID 100 on machineA, Bob has
 UID 100 on machineB. These translate to UIDs 1000 and 1001 on the common
filesystem. Process of Alice writes to a file and Bob becomes to be over
quota. In this situation, there would be probably two processes (from
machineA and machineB) listening on the netlink socket. We want to send a
message so that on Alice's desktop we can show a message: "You caused
Bob to exceed his quotas" and of Bob's desktop: "Alice has caused that you
are over quota.".
  Because there may be is not a notion of Bob on machineA or of Alice on
machineB, we are in trouble, right? What I like the most is to use the
filesystem identities (as you suggested in some other email). I. e. because
both Alice and Bob share a filesystem, identities of both have to make sense
to it (for example for purposes of permission checking). So we can probably
send via netlink these (in our example ids 1000 and 1001) and hope that
inside machineA and machineB there will be a way to translate these
identities to names "Alice" and "Bob". So that user can understand what
is happenning. Does this sound plausible?
  If we go this route, then we only need a kernel function, that will
for a pair ($filesystem, $task) return indentity of that $task used
for operations on $filesystem...
