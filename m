Great! Thanks.

Thank you, Oren and Serge! I will revisit this issue then, but
I have a vacation the next week and, after this, we have a New
Year and Christmas holidays in Russia. So I will be able to go
on with it only after the 7th January :( Hope this is OK for you.

Besides, Andrew told that he would pay little attention to new
features till the 2.6.24 release, so I'm afraid we won't have this 
even in -mm in the nearest months :(

Thanks,
Pavel
