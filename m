page_set_volatile has a "writable" argument. For writable==0 you get a
Vx page, for writable==1 you get a Px page.

With stable_if_clean you are refering to stable_if_present? If yes the
answer is that this operation is used to get a page from Vx/Px back to
Sx but only if the page has not been discarded. The operation will fail
if the page state is Vz/Pz. The dirty bit only matters for the hosts
decision to discard the page, these are the state transitions from Vr/Pr
to Vz.

Your understanding is good, but how can I make this less confusing? A Px
page that is dirty may not be discarded which makes it basically stable.
The guest state still is potential volatile though as it does not have a
state of Sx.
