I don't think so.
Just exporting elv_register_queue() will cause some maintenance costs
to request-based dm developers as below.

Although currently only elevator is the queue's feature which is
needed for only request-based dm, such other features may be added
to queue in the future.
Then, the developer who added the feature may not notice that
request-based dm needs to register the feature here, if there
is no critical problem (e.g. compile error or panic) without it.
That causes the lack of such features only in request-based dm.
Therefore, request-based dm developers always have to watch
the change of the block-layer and make the registration related code.
I think it's a sort of big maintenance cost.

So we should make the code as the change of the block-layer becomes
effective automatically in request-based dm, too, as mush as possible.
In this case, you should make/call an interface for the whole queue,
not only for the elevator, since dm can't/shouldn't know how
blk_init_allocated_queue() initializes the queue.
(And the interface should be used in other generic paths (e.g. add_disk()))
That's a proper block-layer interface which I mentioned, and this
approach should have less overhead than your approach from view point
of longer period.

Right, so I said "Updating may not be easy."
(By the way, wasting CPU cycles doesn't matter here, since it happens
 only when we initialize the device and it shouldn't too much.)

I think this is a better solution than exposing a part of queue
internals as I described above.

I don't think it's better as I described above.
(dm can't/shouldn't know how blk_init_allocated_queue() initializes
 the queue.)



By the way, another approach to optimizing the memory usage would be
to determine whether the dm device is bio-based or request-based
at the device creation time, instead of the table binding time.
We want the delayed allocation, since kernel can't decide the device
type until the first table is bound because of the auto-detection
mechanism.  The auto-detection is good for keeping compatibility with
existing user-space tools.  But once user-space tools are changed to
specify device type at the device creation time, we can eventually
remove the auto-detection.
Then, kernel can decide device type in alloc_dev(), so
the initialization code in kernel will become very simple.

FYI, actually, I had this approach in a very early stage of
request-based dm development:
    [kernel]     http://marc.info/?l=dm-devel&m=116656637419846&w=2
    [kernel]     http://marc.info/?l=dm-devel&m=116656689701459&w=2
    [kernel]     http://marc.info/?l=dm-devel&m=116656689707043&w=2
    [user-space] http://marc.info/?l=dm-devel&m=116656689906056&w=2
Now, you can change user-space first before kernel, since
request-based dm is already available.
