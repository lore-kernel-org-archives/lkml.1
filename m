This is fundamentally wrong.  Many filesystems today use either barriers
or flushes (if barriers are not supported), and the times when disk drives
were lying to the OS that the cache got flushed are long gone.

I highly doubt barriers will ever be supported on anything but simple
raid1, because it's impossible to guarantee ordering across multiple
drives.  Well, it *is* possible to have write barriers with journalled
(and/or with battery-backed-cache) raid[456].

Note that even if raid[456] does not support barriers, write cache
flushes still works.
