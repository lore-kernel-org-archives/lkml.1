That can't work as is since you can't specify major:minor in policy.
So all we could do again is simply refuse all mknod, which we can
already do with per-process capability bounding sets.

Aw, crap!  That's right, I remember noticing a few days later that it
wasn't in my git index any more.

An older version (by about a month) of the patch with the LSM coded
straight into the cgroup file is appended below.

That happened in a later thread in december:

Subject: [PATCH 1/1] cgroups: implement device whitelist cgroup+lsm

Implement a cgroup using the LSM interface to enforce open and mknod
on device files.  Not a line of this code is expected to be used in a
final version, this is just a proof of concept.

No stacking is implemented, so to test this you must have

	CGROUPS=y
	SECURITY=y

but all other LSMs =n (no capabilities, no selinux, no rootplug).

This implements a simple device access whitelist.  A whitelist entry
has 4 fields.  'type' is a (all), c (char), or b (block).  'all' means it
applies to all types, all major numbers, and all minor numbers.  Major and
minor are obvious.  Access is a composition of r (read), w (write), and
m (mknod).

The root devcgroup starts with rwm to 'all'.  A child devcg gets a copy
of the parent.  Admins can then add and remove devices to the whitelist.
Once CAP_HOST_ADMIN is introduced it will be needed to add entries as
well or remove entries from another cgroup, though just CAP_SYS_ADMIN
will suffice to remove entries for your own group.

An entry is added by doing "echo <type> <maj> <min> <access>" > devcg.allow,
for instance:

	echo b 7 0 mrw > /cgroups/1/devcg.allow

An entry is removed by doing likewise into devcg.deny.  Since this is a
pure whitelist, not acls, you can only remove entries which exist in the
whitelist.  You must explicitly

	echo a 0 0 mrw > /cgroups/1/devcg.deny

to remove the "allow all" entry which is automatically inherited from
the root cgroup.

While composing this with the ns_cgroup may seem logical, it may not
be the right thing to do.  Note that each newly created devcg gets
a copy of the parent whitelist.  So if you had done

	mount -t cgroup -o ns,devcg none /cgroups

then once a process in /cgroup/1 had done an unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)
it would be under /cgroup/1/node_<pid>
if an admin did

	echo b 7 0 m > /cgroups/1/devcg.deny

then the entry would still be in the whitelist for /cgroups/1/node_<pid>.
Something to discuss if we get that far before nixing this whole idea.
