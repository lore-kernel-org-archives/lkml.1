FWIW: You'll see bigger deltas if you boot with intel_iommu=strict, but
those will be because of waiting on IOMMU hardware to flush caches and
may further hide effects of gong with a bitmap as opposed to a RB tree.

I'm going to be out of contact for a few weeks but this work sounds
interesting.

I'll look closely at your patch later.
