Greetings Yu and Sheng,

So the original attachment was for the v2.6.29-fc11 host kernel output,
I ended up jumping to v2.6.30-rc3 (and making sure CONFIG_PCI_IOV was
enabled) for KVM host with kvm-85 and now things are looking quite
stable for me.

So far I have been able to successfully push LIO-Target v3.0 traffic
*inside* a v2.6.29.2 KVM guest via the onboard e1000e (02:00.0) port
from another Linux/iSCSI Initiator machine using a Intel 1 Gb/sec port.
I am running badblocks tests to iSCSI Logical Units for RAMDISK_DR and
FILEIO storage objects (in the KVM Guest), and they are passing
validation and I am seeing ~500 Mb/sec of throughput and very low CPU
usage in the KVM guests.

One issue I did notice while using the pci-stub method of
device-assignment with same e1000 port (02:00.0) was while using an
iSCSI Initiator (Open-iSCSI) on the KVM Host machine and doing sustained
traffic into the LIO-Target KVM Guest on the same local KVM host to max
out traffic between the other onboard e1000e port (03.00.0), I see the
following:

pci-stub 0000:02:00.0: PCI INT A -> GSI 17 (level, low) -> IRQ 17
assign device: host bdf = 2:0:0
pci-stub 0000:02:00.0: irq 59 for MSI/MSI-X

Attached are the v2.6.30-rc3 KVM host and v2.6.29.2 KVM guest dmesg
output.  When the 'Unbalanced enable for IRQ 59' happens on the KVM
host, I do not see any exceptions in KVM guest (other than the iSCSI
connections drop), but it requires a restart of KVM+qemu-system-x86_64
to get the e1000e port back up.

Other than that loopback scenario, things are looking good quite good
with this combination of kvm-85 kernel+guest so far for me.  I did end
up taking out the two 8x function 2x Path/Function PCIe IOV adapters for
now, as it seemed to have an effect on stability with all of MSI-X
interrupts enabled on the KVM host for 16 virtual adapters.

I will keep testing with e1000e ports and let the list know the
progress.  Thanks for your comments!
