The following series fixes several problems causing hangs while
rmmoding the cciss driver. In the process of fixing these hangs, I
also reworked the the logical drive scanning kernel thread to use one
thread per driver rather than one thread per controller. I also added
a sysfs attribute to kick off a controller scan.

Changelog

v2

Staticially initialize scan_mutex and scan_q.
Remove unneeded function declarations.
Added a patch that uses a mutex to indicate we are busy initializing
rather than a integer flag.
Remove a possible scan race by moving the busy_initializing unlock after
the call to rebuild_luntable in cciss_init_one.
Reworked the scan thread to use a more traditional loop with a
set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE); schedule() at the top of the
loop.

      cciss: remove logical drive sysfs entries during driver cleanup.
      cciss: use mutex instead of flag to indicate busy initializing
      cciss: use only one scan thread
      cciss: kick off logical drive topology rescan through sysfs
