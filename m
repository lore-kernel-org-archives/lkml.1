Uhm, i dont maintain SCSI and dont intend to. I got a fix patch 
from an SCSI person for a lockup bug i reported on the SCSI 
list, caused by a commit authored by that same SCSI person, and 
i applied the fix.

The real question is, why didnt your review and testing skills 
catch the serious lockups caused by:

    commit b60af5b0adf0da24c673598c8d3fb4d4189a15ce
    Date:   Mon Nov 3 15:56:47 2008 -0500
    [SCSI] simplify scsi_io_completion()

... and why is the bug still unfixed today in the upstream 
kernel?

The thing is, we triggered the lockups quite easily in -rt and 
-tip testing - and we are not set up to catch SCSI bugs at all. 
We are set up to test and catch bugs in the areas of the kernel 
we are interested in mainly.

Uhm, then why didnt you revert the original commit? I clearly 
identified it to you as the root trigger of the lockup and 
confirmed that reverting it fixes the hang, and i invested many 
days of testing into that.
 
When i reported this very serious and potentially data 
corrupting bug to you on January 15th you immediately suggested 
it's a problem with the commit above.

So you were in full knowledge of the root cause of the breakage 
- but why have you not reverted it? Doing a speedy revert is a 
must-have for any bug that has data corruption potential.

What you did is akin to playing russian roulette with other 
people's data. You knew about a serious, data corruptor 
breakage, you knew which change caused it, but still you didnt 
act to revert the patch or resolve the problem.

The expected behavior from an upstream maintainer is not to 
introduce breakages and wait until the "real cause" is 
understood. The expected behavior is to either fix or revert a 
commit that has been pinpointed as the source of a serious bug. 
You didnt do that - why?

Uhm, below is the so-called "diagnostic" patch you sent to me 
and the problem with that "patch" is that it does not tell us 
anything we did not know already.

It just confirms that the function locks up - and we already 
knew that much from all the logs i sent to you. I.e. that 
"patch" is an utter waste of my time and you should know that.

I bisect commits, i test fixes, but i dont test silly 
half-hearted "diagnostic" patches which must have taken you less 
than 1 minute to write and would waste 30 minutes of my time to 
test - for no objective purpose. It has no chance to give us any 
new information. I really have better things to do with my time.

James, you ned to try harder to get bugs fixed and you need to 
treat your testers better. Come up with a real diagnostic patch 
that tells us something useful and i'll run it. Until then i'll 
just ignore your rants.

OK, try this.

But could we take this to the scsi-list so that others get a chance to
give suggestions and you're not single threaded on me.

Thanks,

James
