HI James,

I got some idea about fusion driver from this link
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12195

And i found there is bug in fusion driver (kernel version 2.6.10) from this link
http://www.nabble.com/MPT-fusion-driver,-better-but-still-buggy-at-errors-handling-under-2.6-td1095505.html

yes its error handler sequence. But as describe into the above
link(http://www.nabble.com/MPT-fusion-driver,-better-but-still-buggy-at-errors-handling-under-2.6-td1095505.html)
that
2.6.xx  xx <= 11, enters an infinit loop attempting to reset the SCSI
        so the box gets unusable and requires a rough power cycle to recover.

So i think that is  the reason to restart the server(after "Attempting host
reset! )as a power cycle is required to recover.

when next time server was booting i got  some kernel messages on
recovery of SCSI. So recovery is done after reboot the server.

Still i do not know how to over come this bug fo infinite loop. If you
have any suggestion please let me know.
