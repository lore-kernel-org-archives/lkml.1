It would seem that that space could be allocated and populated when 
raid6 was first used, as part of the initialization. I haven't looked at 
that code since it was new, so I might be optimistic about doing it that 
way.

Everything matters. "Take care of the pennies and the dollars will take 
care of themselves" is not just an old German proverb.
