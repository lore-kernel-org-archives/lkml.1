I had already noticed that, and was even *expecting* you to reply with
*exactly* this ;-)

[ BTW CRYPTO is _not_ always built-in -- but only when CONFIG_CRYPTO=y ]

Anyway, the natural follow-up to your argument is -- why is the other
stuff in CRYPTO always built-in too ?

Take the crypto_alloc_xxx() callchain for example (I chose it because
it is the _first_ call any cryptoapi user ever has to make, and hence
it's the one that deals with module-loading stuff).

So what finally got exported out of crypto/ to the rest of the kernel
was just the crypto_alloc_xxx() wrapper. That resolves to a call to
crypto_alloc_base() in crypto/api.c, which first loads the specific
low-level algo modules, and then proceeds to crypto_init_ops(), which
itself may, say, resolve to a crypto_init_digest_ops() -- the only
interface exported from digest.c.

The point is, because the module-loading (if necessary) already takes
place before the call to digest.c is made, there is _no_ reason why
even digest.c can't be made modular -- or _any_ of the other CRYPTO
stuff (with the exception of api.c itself, of course) that "always
gets built-in" as you mentioned above.

And so caring about the optimization of making ALGAPI modular rather
than simply built-in with rest of "core" crypto stuff such as digest.c
(which could _also_ have been made modular by the same logic but wasn't)
sounds like a bogus argument to me. [ BTW did you notice that the
__crypto_alloc_tfm() has been EXPORT_SYMBOL'ed _only_ because of one
solitary modular-callsite in algapi.c ? ]
