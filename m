Ok, so most of the of the integrity errors are processed by an
error like this:

drivers/scsi/sata_sil24.c index contains -98 extra bytes
unpacking file drivers/scsi/sata_sil24.c 5715cdfceaca: Error -5 while decompressing data

That's an -EIO and not a normal error to report. Are there any
errors in dmesg or syslog corresponding to this?

The errors tend to imply problems decompressing and patching files,
not that truncates are occurring once the files have been patched.
Can you check that what is being pulled from the repository is correct
before it gets uncompressed?

Cheers,

Dave.
