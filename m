<now works fine>

Have to say that I didn't wait N seconds in the beginning,
 but just rather

 - plop cdrom in
 - close tray
 - mount -r /cdrom while disc is still spinning

Unfortunately I only have this after eject/remount:

[asuardi@sandman ~]$ cat /sys/block/sr0/size
9133120

Final note, as I said earlier in the thread, this is definitely
 an occurrence of first device access after boot - as I just
 rebooted:

[asuardi@sandman ~]$ uptime
 23:25:28 up 17 min,  6 users,  load average: 0.09, 0.18, 0.15
