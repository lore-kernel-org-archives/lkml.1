You can first get to the scsi_device in isd200_ata_command().  The last
place you can get to the scsi_device (if one exists!) is
quiesce_and_remove_host() -- but that's part of the core, not specific
to isd200.

Not at all.  isd200_free_info_ptrs() frees everything pointed to by the
info structure, and the info structure itself is freed later on by the
usb-storage core in usb_stor_release_resources().

If you wanted to free it in isd200_free_info_ptrs() you could; just 
make sure to set us->extra to NULL when you do, to avoid a double-free 
error.
