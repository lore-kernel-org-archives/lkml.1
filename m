The drives themselves will support barriers - they are the same S-ATA/ATA drives 
you get normally for your desktop, etc.

I think that e-SATA would have no trouble (but fewer boxes have that external 
S-ATA port). Not sure how reliable the SCSI -> USB -> ATA conversion is for USB 
drives though (a lot of moving pieces there!).

VM testing is a good idea, but I worry that the virtual IO stack support for 
data integrity is still somewhat shaky. Christoph was working on fixing various 
bits and pieces I think...
