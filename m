  Good catch, that's indeed a problem.

  Yes that needs to be solved. I also looked into it and it's too much work
to do it in a one big sweep. But I think we could do the conversion
filesystem by filesystem - see below.
  Admittedly, I don't like your solution very much. It looks strange to
check write_io_error when *reading* the buffer and I'm afraid we could
introduce bugs e.g. by clearing write_io_error bit so that ext3_bread would
then fail to detect the error condition or by some other code deciding to
read the buffer from disk via other function than just ext3_bread. So I
think it would be much better to set back uptodate flag shortly after the
failed write or not clear it at all.
  Now here's how I think we could achieve that without having to change all
other filesystems: We could create a new superblock flag which would mean
that "this filesystem handles write_io_error and doesn't want to clear
uptodate flag". Filesystems with this capability would set this flag when
calling get_sb_bdev. And if write IO fails we check this flag
(via bh->b_bdev->bd_super->s_flags) and clear / not clear uptodate flag
accordingly. What do you think?
  I know it's more work than your quick fix but it should fix all these
problems for ext3 once for all and it would be much cleaner...
