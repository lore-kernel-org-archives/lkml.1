Umm. We're talking kernel panics here. If it's not in memory, it doesn't 
exist as far as the kernel is concerned.

If it doesn't exist, it cannot be reported.

No. I'm blaming inlining for making debugging harder.

And that's ok - IF IT IS WORTH IT.

It's not. Gcc inlining decisions suck. gcc inlines stuff that doesn't 
really help from being inlined, and doesn't inline stuff that _does_.

What's so hard to accept in that?

Good luck with that. Go ahead and try it.  You'll find it wasn't so easy 
after all.

No, you're stuck because you apparently have your mind stuck on a 
crash-dump, and aren't willing to look at alternatives.

You could use a network console. Trust me - if you can't set up a network 
console, you have no business mucking around with crash dumps.

And if the crash is hard enough that you can't any output from that, 
again, a crash dump wouldn't exactly help, would it?

Umm. And why do you think the two have anything to do with each other?

Only insane people want the kernel to write to disk when it has problems. 
Sane people try to write to something that doesn't potentially overwrite 
their data. Like the network.

Which is there. Try it. Trust me, it's a _hell_ of a lot more likely to 
wotk than a crash dump.
