The point is that "missing" a signal because of freeze/thaw (or stop/cont)
is perfectly acceptable behavior. It is supposed to work that way. So I
argue that we don't need a workaround.

Why is it the case ?

At the end of restart, the container remains frozen until you unfreeze it.
So c/r effectively becomes freeze/unfreeze, except - possible - for page
fault that are more likely to happen when thawing following the restart
(and these may slow down the application and allow a signal to "slip in").

If it's nearly 100% of the tests, that it should be easily reproducible
with merely freeze/thaw pairs, no ?

Still, arguing that LTP "breaks" here is like arguing that LTP "breaks"
if we were to run it while sending SIGSTOP/SIGCONT to its processes...

did you see any problem outside LTP ?  I never saw any such problems.

Sure: see addition above.

Yes, I mentioned that in the past. Can be addressed in the same manner.

Fact is that people wondered what was going on there.

I prefer the arch-independent way, because it is, well, arch-independent,
and because it makes the logic and the exception obvious to the reader,
and it is easily extensible to handle additional special cases (like
ptrace), and makes maintenance easier.

Do you object to doing it this way ?

Oren.
