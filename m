The reason is not as complicated as I thought. It is because x86
strace don't test TCB_WAITEXECVE. please take a look at defs.h
(strace-4.5.16), the flag is defined as follows:

#ifdef LINUX
# if defined(ALPHA) || defined(SPARC) || defined(SPARC64) ||
defined(POWERPC) || defined(IA64) || defined(HPPA) || defined(SH) ||
defined(SH64) || defined(S390) || defined(S390X) || defined(ARM)
#  define TCB_WAITEXECVE 02000  /* ignore SIGTRAP after exceve */
# endif

I'm not an strace expert, so I have no idea what the TCB_WAITEXECVE means.
And why x86 strace can handle SIGTRAP after execve but ALL other Arch can not..
Could anybody shield some lights on the flag?
