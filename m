Hi.

I have concern about these issues.

I think 1) differs from 2) and 3). 1) should be fixed at least.
Because 1) is hard to understand for normal users.

Probably, if normal users start to use cpu controller, then they must make
same test by way of trial. They will find same results which differ from their
expectation in spite of SIMPLE test case.
Then, they will think cpu controller must have many bugs, and will never
use it.

When 2) and 3), I can explain users the reason like "It's due to accurate
error of internal calculation."
Beacause the test case is a bit fussy, and user will understand it.

However, I can't explain anything for 1), because it seems not fussy case.

When users use cpuset/cpu affinity, then they would like to controll cpu affinity.
Not CPU time.

When users use cpu controller, they would like to controll cpu time, right?
However, the cpu time is far from their expectation. I think it is strange.

To be honest, I don't have any good idea because I'm not familiar with
schduler's code. But I have one question.


1618 static int tg_shares_up(struct task_group *tg, void *data)
1619 {
1620         unsigned long weight, rq_weight = 0, shares = 0;

(snip)

1632         for_each_cpu(i, sched_domain_span(sd)) {
1633                 weight = tg->cfs_rq[i]->load.weight;
1634                 usd->rq_weight[i] = weight;
1635 
1636                 /*
1637                  * If there are currently no tasks on the cpu pretend there
1638                  * is one of average load so that when a new task gets to
1639                  * run here it will not get delayed by group starvation.
1640                  */
1641                 if (!weight)
1642                         weight = NICE_0_LOAD; ---------(*)

I heard from test team when (*) was removed, 1) didn't occur.

The comment said (*) is to avoid starvation condition.
However, I don't understand why NICE_0_LOAD must be specified.
Could you tell me why small value (like 2 or 3) is not used for (*)?
What is side effect?



Thanks.
