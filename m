Actually converting callback.c is not that bad, it just means splitting
up svc_create_thread.  Only problem is whether we want to allow SIGKILL
from serspace to terminate the thread aswell, in which case we still
need changes to the core kthread code which I'm waiting for someone
for the containers crowd to finally implement as it's needed in
various other places.

I'll try to send out my svc_create_thread splitup soon because it's
actually a nice cleanup all by itself.
