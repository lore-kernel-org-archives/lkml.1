See the previous results with deadline scheduler. Deadline scheduler was 
chosen because it doesn't influence the stream of commands by additional 
delays, like CFQ.

Default RA size:

Run at the same time:
#while true; do dd if=/dev/sdc  of=/dev/null bs=64K; done
#dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/null bs=64K count=80000
          a) 4,7 MB/s
          b) 4,6 MB/s
          c) 4,8 MB/s

RA 4096K:

Run at the same time:		
linux-4dtq:~ # while true; do dd if=/dev/sdc  of=/dev/null bs=64K; done	
linux-4dtq:~ # dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/null bs=64K count=80000
	a) 39,5 MB/s
	b) 39,6 MB/s
	c) 37,0 MB/s

Well, RA can work well, but _size_ can be not _too good_. Current 
default 128K is simply much too small. This is why I propose to increase 
it to at least 2M (better 4M) and decrease max_sectors_kb for tagged 
queuing devices to at max 128K (better 64K) to minimize possible latency 
influence.

BTW, Linus recently also found out that "Doing a "echo 64 > 
max_sectors_kb" does seem to make my experience nicer. At no really 
noticeable downside in throughput that I can see"

I took the above numbers on my local system with 15K RPM parallel SCSI 
drive. Also, I forgot to note that, for instance, 128K means "requests 
with sizes between 64K and 128K".

Frankly, I don't have full understanding why it is so, I only see that 
Linux generates very spread by sizes requests from 4K to double RA size. 
I guess, this is because of interaction of how requests are submitted, 
merged and the queue plugging/unplugging.

If you need me to provide you any data/logs to investigate this just let 
me know. I can give you a full list of SCSI commands coming from client, 
for instance.

Actually, you can download SCST and iSCSI-SCST from 
http://scst.sourceforge.net/downloads.html and try yourself. Setup is 
quite simple, see http://scst.sourceforge.net/iscsi-scst-howto.txt.

To get list of coming commands in kernel log you should run after SCST load

# echo "add scsi" >/proc/scsi_tgt/trace_level

Distribution of requests sizes you can find in /proc/scsi_tgt/sgv, count 
of outstanding at any time commands in /proc/scsi_tgt/sessions.

I have two things to say here:

1. Why do you think B and C can't be merged by block layer on the 
server? Default max_sectors_kb 512K perfectly allows that. On practice I 
see it happens all the time:

1.1. Distribution of requests sizes after a number of "dd if=/dev/sdX 
of=/dev/null bs=512K count=2000" calls with deadline IO scheduler on the 
both sides:

4K                       216
8K                       60
16K                      77
32K                      138
64K                      200
128K                     11276
256K                     18474
 >=512K                   0

Look, how many there are 256K requests. Most.

1.2. I can see how many requests at time sent by client. In most cases 
this number is 1 and only sometimes 2.

1.3. I made some measurements on my local single drive system, capable 
to produce 130MB/s reads, with deadline IO scheduler on the both sides 
and a *single IO thread* on the server:

# dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/null bs=512K count=2000
2000+0 records in
2000+0 records out
1048576000 bytes (1.0 GB) copied, 16.6582 seconds, 62.9 MB/s

This is about 60% of maximum possible bandwidth. So, definitely, 
pipelining works rather doesn't work.

But with max_sectors_kb set to 32K on the client situation gets much better:

# dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/null bs=512K count=2000
2000+0 records in
2000+0 records out
1048576000 bytes (1.0 GB) copied, 10.602 seconds, 98.9 MB/s

Requests distribution:

4K                       7570
8K                       755
16K                      1334
32K                      31478
 >=64K                    0

At time there are up to 8 outstanding requests, 5 in average.

Here pipelining definitely does work. 57% improvement.

2. At practice, there are many cases, when there are >2 "pipes" with 
limited bandwidth. The simplest example is when data digest used with 
iSCSI. Here there are data digest calculation (CRC32C) "pipe" on both 
client and server. So, for maximum throughput the pipelining depth 
should be at least 4. See the measurements (setup is the same as above):

Default:

# dd if=/dev/sde of=/dev/null bs=512K count=2000
2000+0 records in
2000+0 records out
1048576000 bytes (1.0 GB) copied, 21.9438 seconds, 47.8 MB/s

max_sectors_kb 32K:

# dd if=/dev/sde of=/dev/null bs=512K count=2000
2000+0 records in
2000+0 records out
1048576000 bytes (1.0 GB) copied, 15.4442 seconds, 67.9 MB/s

48% improvement.

NULLIO (i.e. without disk access):

Default:

# dd if=/dev/sdh of=/dev/null bs=512K count=2000
2000+0 records in
2000+0 records out
1048576000 bytes (1.0 GB) copied, 16.0533 seconds, 65.3 MB/s

max_sectors_kb 32K:

# dd if=/dev/sdh of=/dev/null bs=512K count=2000
2000+0 records in
2000+0 records out
1048576000 bytes (1.0 GB) copied, 12.6053 seconds, 83.2 MB/s

28% improvement.

Impressive difference, isn't it?

Another example where deep pipelining is needed is hardware RAID cards, 
like 3ware (see below).

Hmm, I can't recall SCSI has any priority bit. And, if it had, for what 
it should be used?

Yes, definitely. I feel, if I wanted, I could have PhD or two in this 
area :-)

Yes, this is rarely possible state, because all the modern HDDs have at 
least 2MB RA buffer. But still possible, especially with old/cheap HDDs 
with small built-in buffer.

No, I don't think it's anyhow related to the stripe sizes. I believe, 
it's rather related to the fact that those cards are physical RAIDs, 
i.e. have built-in CPU and big internal memory (hundreds of MBs), hence 
have additional internal data transfer links, hence need deeper 
pipelining to work in full performance.

Search "baseline" word in one of my previous e-mails (one with the 
measurement results). For your convenience it is:

Default RA size with deadline:

Run at the same time:
#while true; do dd if=/dev/sdc  of=/dev/null bs=64K; done
#dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/null bs=64K count=80000
          a) 4,7 MB/s
          b) 4,6 MB/s
          c) 4,8 MB/s
