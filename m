Xdd is really useful for me. Thanks for letting me know.

Your results show all xdd programs belong to the same cgroup,
could you explain me in detail about your test procedure?

To know how many I/Os are actually issued to a physical device in
buffered mode within a measurement period, you should check the
/sys/block/<dev>/stat file just before starting a test program and
just after the end of the test program. The contents of the stat file
is described in the following document:
   kernel/Documentation/block/stat.txt

The followings are the results on my PC with SATA disk, and there is
no big difference between with and without dm-ioband. Please try the
same thing if you have time.
