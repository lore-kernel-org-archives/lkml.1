Sorry, these where IBM p505 express (not p404, duh) which had a 2x
socket 2x core POWER5 setup.  These along with an IBM X-series machine)
where the only ones available for PCI-X v2.0, and this probably is still
the case. :-)

Also, these numbers where with a ~9000 MTU (I don't recall what the
hardware limit on the 10 Gb/sec switch lwas) doing direct struct iovec
to preallocated struct page mapping for payload on the target side.
This is known as RAMDISK_DR plugin in the LIO-SE.  On the initiator, LTP
disktest and O_DIRECT where used for direct to SCSI block device access.

I can big up this paper if anyone is interested.
