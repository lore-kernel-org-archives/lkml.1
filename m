Subject: ext4 ioctl(FIEMAP) bug? observed in 2.6.29.4 (32-bit x86)

I have been stressing out the FIEMAP ioctl() quite a bit recently,
while working on the wiper.sh SSD TRIM utility (part of the hdparm package).

For an hour or so today, things got very confusing.
My wiper.sh script stopped working correctly, and I narrowed
it down to FIEMAP's incorrect use of the "LAST" flag.

Normally, FIEMAP signals the final extent of a file by
setting the "LAST" bit (bit-0) in flags.
When the application sees this flag, it knows it should
not need to issue any more FIEMAP calls.

But suddenly, for a couple of hours today, FIEMAP began
setting the "LAST" flag on every single FIEMAP call,
tricking my code into thinking that the file being
queried was a lot smaller than it really was.

No strace(), because I still hadn't figured-out what was going on,
but I did save this trace from debug code inside hdparm.

The file being FIEMAP'd was a 50GB+ file, filling the ext4
filesystem to near 100% capacity.  I have no idea what caused
FIEMAP to misbehave, but after a couple of hours it suddenly
started working correctly again.

This was all observed on 32-bit x86 Linux-2.6.29.4,
and no, it is not reproduceable.

A command-line "sync" was done before the file was
opened for FIEMAP.

The output below shows the sequence of FIEMAP calls
on the single massive file.  Notice that the first call
returned the "LAST" flag set, despite there being many
many more extents after that bunch.

Cheers
