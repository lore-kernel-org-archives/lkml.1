By "both" above, do you mean we should give user the flexibility if it
wants the filesize changed or not ? It can be done by having *two* modes
for preallocation in the system call - say FA_PREALLOCATE and
FA_ALLOCATE. If we use FA_PREALLOCATE mode, fallocate() will allocate
blocks, but will not change the filesize and [cm]time. If FA_ALLOCATE
mode is used, fallocate() will change the filesize if required (i.e.
when allocation is beyond EOF) and also update [cm]time.
This way, the application can decide what it wants.

This will be helpfull for the partial allocation scenario also. Think of
the case when we do not change the filesize in fallocate() and expect
applications/posix_fallocate() to do ftruncate() after fallocate() for
this. Now if fallocate() results in a partial allocation with -ENOSPC
error returned, applications/posix_fallocate() will not know for what
length ftruncate() has to be called.  :(

Hence it may be a good idea to give user the flexibility if it wants to
atomically change the file size with preallocation or not. But, with
more flexibility there comes inconsistency in behavior, which is worth
considering.

Ok. But, some people may not expect/like this. I think, we can keep it
on the backburner for a while, till other issues are sorted out.

Ok.

Having additional mode (of FA_PREALLOCATE) might help here too. Please
see above.
