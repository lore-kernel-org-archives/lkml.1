Yup (or I don't know, I'm sure there was or is some problem with
ptrace, that could be used to create unkillable processes).

Fuse could actually be fixed to exit reliably for 'killall5 -9' (it
used to), but that has other problems, and it doesn't seem very
important to me.  But this can be discussed.

What cannot be fixed is if one process is inside an fs operation
(e.g. unlink), holding a VFS lock (i_mutex) and another process goes
to uninterruptible sleep on that lock.  There's no way (other than
rewriting the VFS) in which that second process could be killed unless
you kill the first one or the fuse server.

You can't.  But that's only solvable with

 - rewrite of VFS (see above)
 - rewrite of freezer

You can still do that.  If a process cannot be killed with 'kill -9',
due to being deadlocked with itself through fuse (not an easy feat to
accomplish), then it's not going to do any more harm, and you _can_
get rid of it by forced umounting the filesystem, or if it has been
detached, through the fusectl filesystem.

Making filesystem operations restartable is not easy.  I would say
near impossible, but I haven't given a lot of enery into investigating.

Sure, but you can check in other ways (/proc/$PID/wchan), sysrq-t.

Heh, there are all very interesting, but most of these issues are not
even on my todo list (which has grown into quite a big pile over the
years), which means, that they don't seem to matter to people in
practice.

You seem to be implying that fuse is worthless if these issues are not
fixed, but that is very far from the truth, I think.
