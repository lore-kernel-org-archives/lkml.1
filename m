Having retained this new configuration for a couple of days now I haven't had 
any problems.
This is good but not really ideal since / isn't mirrored anymore :(

I was trying to say that I don't actually see any errors being handled in normal 
operation.
I'm not sure if you are saying that these PHY RDY events are normally handled 
quietly (which would explain it).

yes - but the erroring device which is not being used is on the same controller 
as the device with the in-use resume partition.

yes

Yes, that's consistent with what I'm seeing.

When I move the swap/resume partition to a different controller (ie when I broke 
the / mirror and used the freed space) the problem seems to go away.

I am seeing messages in dmesg though:

That's kinda hard; swap and root are on different drives...

Does it help that although the errors above appear, the system seems OK when I 
just use the other controller?

I have to be cautious what I do with this machine as it's the wife's active 
desktop box <grin>.
