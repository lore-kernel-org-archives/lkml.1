It is not only for system administrators; I was trying to find out if
kernel is buggy, and that should be in kernel tree.

ext3 documentation states that journal protects fs integrity on
powerfail. If you don't want to talk about storage stacks, perhaps
that should be removed?

Now... You mocked me up for 'ext3 expects disks to behave like disks
(alarmist)'. I actually believe that should be written somewhere. ext3
depends on fairly subtle storage disk characteristics, and many common
configs just do not meet the expectations (missing barriers is most
common, followed by collateral damage).

Maybe not documenting that was okay 10 years ago, but with all the USB
sticks and raid arrays around, its just sloppy. Because those
characteristics are not documented, storage stack authors do not know
what they have to guarantee, and the result is bad. See for example
nbd -- it does not propagate barriers and is therefore unsafe.
