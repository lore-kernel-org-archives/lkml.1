No, even though it was Cc:ed to me - sorry.
Maybe a revised subject line would have helped... maybe not.

Yeah, do that.  I'll send you something new.
I'll move that chunk into a different patch and add the extra bits
needed to make that test correct in *all* cases rather than just the
ones I was thinking about at the time.
My test suit does try in-kernel-autodetect (the problem case) but it
didn't catch this bug due to another bug.  I'll fix that too.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
