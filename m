OK, so in this case you don't need to set rtime on the every single
file inode, but only directory inode, right?  Because you're only
using checking the rtime at the directory level, and not the flag.
And it's just as easy for you to check the rtime flag for the file's
containing directory (modulo magic vis-a-vis hard links) as the file's
inode.

I'm just really wishing that rtime and the rtime flag didn't have live
on disk, but could rather be in memory.  If you only needed to save
the directory flags and rtimes, that might actually be doable.

Note by the way that since you need to own the file/directory to set
flags, this means that only programs that are running as root or
running as the uid who owns the entire subtree will be able to use
this scheme.  One advantage of doing in kernel memory is that you
might be able to support watching a tree that is not owned by the
watcher.

OK, so in the worst case every single file in a kernel source tree
might change after doing an extreme git checkout.  That means around
36k of files get updated.  So if you have to set/clear the rtime flag
during the checkout process 36k file inodes would have to have their
rtime flag cleared, plus 2k worth of directory inodes; but those would
probably be folded into other changes made to the inodes anyway.  But
then when trackerd goes back and scans the subtree, if you are
actually setting rtime flags for every single file inode, then that's
38k of indoes that need updating.  If you only need to set the rtime
flags for directories, that's only 2k worth of extra gratuitous inode
updates.
