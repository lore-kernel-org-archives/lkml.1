     [XFS] Fix inode size update before data write in xfs_setattr

     When changing the file size by a truncate() call, we log the change in the
     inode size. However, we do not flush any outstanding data that might not
     have been written to disk, thereby violating the data/inode size update
     order. This can leave files full of NULLs on crash.

     Hence if we are truncating the file, flush any unwritten data that may lie
     between the curret on disk inode size and the new inode size that is being
     logged to ensure that ordering is preserved.

     [XFS] Allow punching holes to free space when at ENOSPC

     Make the free file space transaction able to dip into the reserved blocks
     to ensure that we can successfully free blocks when the filesystem is at
     ENOSPC.

     [XFS] Implement ->page_mkwrite in XFS.

     Hook XFS up to ->page_mkwrite to ensure that we know about mmap pages
     being written to. This allows use to do correct delayed allocation and
     ENOSPC checking as well as remap unwritten extents so that they get
     converted correctly during writeback. This is done via the generic
     block_page_mkwrite code.

commit 5417169026c3df151adf5a65eb061278b0a72e69
Author: David Chinner <dgc@sgi.com>
Date:   Thu Jul 19 17:39:55 2007 +1000

     [FS] Implement block_page_mkwrite.

     Many filesystems need a ->page-mkwrite callout to correctly
     set up pages that have been written to by mmap. This is especially
     important when mmap is writing into holes as it allows filesystems
     to correctly account for and allocate space before the mmap
     write is allowed to proceed.

     Protection against truncate races is provided by locking the page
     and checking to see whether the page mapping is correct and whether
     it is beyond EOF so we don't end up allowing allocations beyond
     the current EOF or changing EOF as a result of a mmap write.
