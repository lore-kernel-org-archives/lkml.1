I have scsi patches!



mptbase-reset-ioc-initiator-during-pci-resume.patch

  Fixes suspend/resume on all of Darrick's MPT cards.  I first merged it
  in September 2007.

kill-warnings-in-mptbaseh-on-parisc64.patch

  Warning fixes.

dell-cerc-support-for-megaraid_mbox.patch

  Turns non-booting machiens into booting ones.  Merged in -mm in
  November 2007.

3w-raid-drivers-memset-not-needed-in-probe.patch

  Small optimisation

scsi-aic94xx-cleanups.patch

  cleanups only.

scsi-qlogicptic-section-fixes.patch

  Fixes a reference from .text into .init.text and hence might fix a
  machine crash when this driver is build into vmlinux.  Merged a week ago.

megaraid-outb_p-extermination.patch

  Cleanup

gdth-convert-to-pci-hotplug-api.patch

  Just merged


So several of these patches address quite seriosu bugs, and have been
stuck in my tree for far too long.
