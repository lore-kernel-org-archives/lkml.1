That's a separate issue.

I'm working on increasing the idmapper scalability, however another
project is currently taking up most of my time. I can't guarantee that
the revised idmapper code will be finished in time to allow for
inclusion in 2.6.32.

NFSv4 aspires to be an internet-wide protocol, and so you cannot use
uids/gids: they just aren't guaranteed to represent a unique user
outside your local LDAP/NIS or /etc/passwd domain. Furthermore, uids and
gids are a posix construct. They simply don't work in environments where
you may have lots of non-posix systems.
