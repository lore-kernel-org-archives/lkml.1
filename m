Well, I don't know about you, but the "don't inline a single instruction" 
sounds a bit stupid to me. And yes, that's exactly what triggered this 
whole thing.

We have two examples of gcc doing that, one of which was even a modern 
version of gcc, where we had sone absolutely _everything_ on a source 
level to make sure that gcc could not possibly screw up. Yet it did:

	static inline int constant_test_bit(int nr, const volatile unsigned long *addr)
	{
	        return ((1UL << (nr % BITS_PER_LONG)) &
	                (((unsigned long *)addr)[nr / BITS_PER_LONG])) != 0;
	}

	#define test_bit(nr, addr)                      \
	        (__builtin_constant_p((nr))             \
	         ? constant_test_bit((nr), (addr))      \   
	         : variable_test_bit((nr), (addr)))

in this case, Ingo said that changing that _single_ inline to forcing 
inlining made a difference.

That's CRAZY. The thing isn't even called unless "nr" is constant, so 
absolutely _everything_ optimizes away, and that whole function was 
designed to give us a single instruction:

	testl $constant,constant_offset(addr)

and nothing else.

Maybe there was something else going on, and maybe Ingo's tests were off, 
but this is an example of gcc not inlining WHEN WE TOLD IT TO, and when 
the function was a single instruction.

How can anybody possibly not consider that to be "stupid"?

The other case (with a single "cmpxchg" inline asm instruction) was at 
least _slightly_ more understandable, in that (a) Ingo claims modern gcc's 
did inline it and (b) the original function actually has a "switch()" 
statement that depends on the argument that is constant, so a stupid 
inliner might believe that it's a big function. But again, we _told_ the 
compiler to inline the damn thing, because we knew better. But gcc didn't.

The other part that is crazy is when gcc inlines large functions that 
aren't even called most of the time (the "ioctl()" switch statements tend 
to be a great example of this - gcc inlines ten or twenty functions, and 
we can guarantee that only one of them is ever called). Yes, maybe it 
makes the code smaller, but it makes the code also undebuggable and often 
BUGGY, because we now have the stack frame of all ten-to-twenty functions 
to contend with.

And notice how "static" has absolutely _zero_ meaning for the above 
example. Yes, the thing is called just from one place - that's how 
something like that very much works. It's a special case. It's not _worth_ 
inlining, especially if it causes bugs. So "called once" or "static" is 
actually totally irrelevant.

And no, they are not marked "inline" (although they are clearly also not 
marked "uninline", until we figure out that gcc is causing system crashes, 
and we add the thing).

If these two small problems were fixed, gcc inlining would work much 
better. But the first one, in particular, means that the "do I inline or 
not" decision would have to happen after expanding and simplifying 
constants. And then, if the end result is big, the inlining gets aborted.
