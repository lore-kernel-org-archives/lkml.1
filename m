Yeah, absolutely everything I've diddled that reduces the size of queued
data improves the situation, which makes perfect sense.  This one was a
bit unexpected.  Front merges didn't hurt at all, back merges did, and
lots.  After diddling the code a bit, I had the "well _duh_" moment.

That's what all the looking I've done ends up at.  Either you let the
disk be all it can be, and you pay in latency, or you don't, and you pay
in throughput.

Cool, think away.  I've been eyeballing and pondering how to know when
latency is going to become paramount.  Absolutely nothing is happening,
even for "it's my root".

I'll give it a shot first thing in the A.M.

Note: I tested my stable of kernels today (22->), and we are better off
dd vs read today than ever in this time span at least.

(i can't recall ever seeing a system where beating snot outta root
didn't hurt really bad... would be very nice though;)
