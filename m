 [OK, I'll start investigating this line. My desktop system was originally (the 
 now lapsed) Peanut Linux, which was a Slackware derivative. But I've been 
 running it for 3 or 4 years, upgrading and adding packages along the way. My 
 udev setup is based on that in a fairly recent Slackware, although I can't now 
 recall precisely which version.]

For the time being I'll try and isolate what it is that causes the delay in 
icons appearing on my desktop when I plug in a usb-storage device. The script 
that shows the icon is invoked by adding the script name to udev's run list. 
Here is a typical rule from /etc/udev/rules.d/20-local.rules:

ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="sd[a-z][0-9]", SYSFS{idProduct}=="6545", 
SYSFS{idVendor}=="0930", SYMLINK+="usbstickc%n", MODE="0666", 
RUN+="/usr/bin/udevshowicon.sh"

I've added a couple of calls to logger (from util-linux-2.12r) to the script. 
What this has shown is that, when I plug in a usb-storage device, there seems 
to be a delay between the usb/scsi/usb-storage drivers setting up the device 
and my icon-showing script being run. Here is the snippet from the kernel log 
file:

And here is the output from the calls to logger, that get written 
to /var/log/messages:

Jun 10 20:28:07 upstairs logger: udevshowicon: starting to get icon name
Jun 10 20:28:07 upstairs logger: udevshowicon: about to show usbstickc1

As you can see, 16 seconds elapses between the drivers finishing and the script 
being run. That's an awful time on a system that is doing nothing (because I'm 
busy scratching my head and looking bewildered :-)

I'm using udev-121, which is pretty recent. There is a later version, but the 
changelog doesn't describe any fixes that (to me) sound as if they would come 
anywhere near this problem.

I'll do so more poking about tomorrow night, but if anyone has any ideas in the 
meantime, I'd be very grateful.

 [ I don't have hotplug installed and CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER_PATH is set to

 [I appreciate that but I was a tint bit worried that, late i the process, I had 
 reported an erronious good or bad to git bisect and ended up in the wrong 
 place.]

I've also attached a log from a boot with CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME enabled.
