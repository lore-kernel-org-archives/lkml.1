  Thanks for the hint. I was guessing that as well. And experiments show
it's definitely connected. To be more precise with the data:
The test machine is 2 CPU, 2 GB ram, simple lowend SATA disk. Tiobench run
with:
tiobench/tiobench.pl -b 65536 -t 16 -t 8 -d /local/scratch -s 4096
  which means 4GB testfile, writes happen in 64k chunks, test done with 16
and 8 threads. /local/scratch is a separate partition always cleaned and
umounted + mounted before each test. The results are (always 3 runs):
    2.6.29+CFQ:           Avg    StdDev
8   38.01 40.26 39.69 ->  39.32  0.955092
16  40.09 38.18 40.05 ->  39.44  0.891104

    2.6.30-rc8+CFQ:
8   36.67 36.81 38.20 ->  37.23  0.69062
16  37.45 36.47 37.46 ->  37.13  0.464351

    2.6.29+NOOP:
8   38.67 38.66 37.55 ->  38.29  0.525632
16  39.59 39.15 39.19 ->  39.31  0.198662

    2.6.30-rc8+NOOP:
8   38.31 38.47 38.16 ->  38.31  0.126579
16  39.08 39.25 39.13 ->  39.15  0.0713364

  So with CFQ there is a statistically meaningful difference and with NOOP
there is not.
  I've also tried plain simple
dd if=/dev/zero of=/local/scratch bs=65536 count=50k
  which gives ~3.6GB file. Also here are noticeable differences alhough
smaller:
  2.6.29+CFQ:       Avg    StdDev
47.5 48.2 48.7      48.133 0.49216

  2.6.30-rc8+CFQ:
45.7 45.7 46.5      45.967 0.37712

  2.6.29+NOOP:
47.1 48.9 48.5      48.167 0.77172

  2.6.30-rc8+NOOP:
46.2 47.1 47.6      46.967 0.57927

  So here we see that even with NOOP, 2.6.30-rc8 is still slower while it's
at the margin of statistical meaningfulness (I can gather more data if
people are interested).
