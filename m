The other 30-40 filesystems that Linux supports manage to do it this
way.  I'm not sure why osdfs is different in this regard.

You need to be careful with the filesystem layout anyway -- when you
upgrade the kernel, it still needs to be able to access all the files
contained in existing filesystems.  And it needs to create new files
which are still readable by older kernels (users have this pesky habit
of downgrading).
