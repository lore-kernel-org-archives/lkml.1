Oh, I'm dense, didn't correctly parse that 4309 was referring back to 3610
for the actual test vectors. I'll see what I can do with those...

I think I'd drop some of the ones in the initial patch in favor of adding
some from 3610, rather than simply adding more. The coverage is already
pretty good, increasing the number of vectors shouldn't really be necessary,
but it would definitely be nice to have vectors that are already publicly
published and verified.
