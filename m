Sounds good.

I will have to look, I need to refresh myself on where all of this code is.
I think hold_net was what I wanted.  A record that there is a user
but not something that will keep the network namespace from going away.

Essentially hold_net should be a debugging check rather then a
real limitation.

Cool.  We can figure out what we need to do to merge them from
there.

True.  And the goal is something maintainable.  There are still a lot
of implications of a device namespace left unexamined so we shall see.
