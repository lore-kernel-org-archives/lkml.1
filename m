No, I'm talking hot unplug here. It is the issue with ext2, but ext2
will run fsck on next mount, making it less severe.

Right. But in ext3 case you basically loose whole filesystem, because
fs is inconsistent and you did not run fsck.

Losing data in page cache is expected. Losing fs consistency is not.

You get single disk failure then powerfail (or reset or kernel
panic). I would not call that double failure. I agree that it will
mean problems for most filesystems.

Anyway, even if that can be called a double failure, this limitation
should be clearly documented somewhere.

...and that's exactly what I'm trying to fix.
