Yes, this is exactly what's done.

Sorry, Boaz, but looks like it is you who don't have the whole picture.
See the end of my previous e-mail.

Isn't it what __blk_rq_map_kern_sg() does?

It is _not_ done. See the end of my previous e-mail.

...which in the majority of cases (if not in all, very possibly) isn't
needed and can be avoided, because the low level drivers then will split 
it again on 16 bytes and the rest to deliver to the target. But it isn't 
related to this our discussion, except as a one more reason to have the 
scsi_io_context allocation.

It can be handled without nents by use of copy_len.
