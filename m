I can argue exactly the same thing, the main motivation for your new 
syscall is to make it possible to restart a process tree for a 
checkpoint / restart and this is orthogonal with adding extended clone 
flags :)

But my main motivation is to have the possibility to a) choose a target 
__and__ b) clone the process relatively to another one. These 2 features 
allows to do what *we* need, that is recreate a process tree and the 
bonus with this approach is the ability to inject a process into a 
namespace, something asked by several people, eg. debug with gdb an 
application running into another pid namespace (is not supported today).

I am sorry for coming late in the discussion and for distracting.

Of course, what is described is what you does with 'clone3' !
Do you think I will come proposing a variant of 'clone3' not doing what 
you need ? :)

And why not. Is there a semantic specifying how a process tree should be 
recreated ?

Ok.

Already tried :)

At this point, I am hesitating of creating a new thread for this 
discussion. Because, there will be:
 * clone
 * clone2
 * clone3

and we will discuss again about a new clone syscall with a different API :(

I will not continue arguing on this thread except if someone is in favor 
of cloneat.
Otherwise, I will spawn a new thread later.

Thanks
