I noticed your point about only one process contending for write on
the new semaphore since cgroup_mutex is also held on the write side.
However won't there be cacheline bouncing as lots of readers contend not
for the read side of the lock itself but the cacheline needed to take it?

This seems like it would be better.

Yup.

Supplanted by RCU perhaps? *shrug*
