Unneeded initialisation.  Could just do

Sorry about all the spelling flames ;) I'd normally just fix them
myself rather than typing them all into an email and having you type
them in again, etc.  But I think the patch needs to be respun anyway.

The mask-and-compare with GFP_KERNEL does appear to be correct, but it
is quite unusual.  Generally in a situation like this we will test for
the specific __GFP_foo flags which we're interested in.  For
documentation reasons if nothing else.

So the preferred form here would be

	if (ret == 0 &&
		(gfp_mask & (__GFP_WAIT|__GFP_FS)) == (__GFP_WAIT|__GFP_FS)) {

which really tells the reader what we're trying to do here.  And I
don't think this code cares about __GFP_IO, even though it would be
mighty peculirr (probably buggy) for someone to do
alloc_pages(__GFP_FS|__GFP_WAIT).

Did we actually need to hold j_state_lock across the
try_to_free_buffers() call here?  Because it'll increase hold times and
will introduce a lock-ranking dependency which we might not otherwise
have had (I didn't check).

Yup, that note is dead.
