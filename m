What the hell is wrong with you?

You're bringing up total red herrings that have nothing to do with 
anything.

My point is:
 - that's not just another driver. That's FIFTY THOUSANDS LINES OF 
   LARGELY INFRASTRUCTURE CRAP.

 - I'm not arguing that we shouldn't merge the driver

 - I'm arguing that you damn well should have used the merge window for 
   something like this!

What part of "it's already -rc3, and you're pushing 50kloc of crap that 
almost nobody will care about" can you not understand?

What part of "merge window" do you have issues with?

What part of "sure, I'll take new drivers after the merge window, but COME 
&*^@ ON!" do you have trouble understanding?

Stop bringing up totally irrelevant crap.
