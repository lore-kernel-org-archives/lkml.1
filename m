(I don't have my Xen hat on at all for this thread.)

We were dealing with checkpointing random sets of processes, and that 
posed all sorts of problems.  Filesystem namespace was one, the pid 
namespace was another.  Doing checkpointing at the container-level 
granularity definitely solves a lot of problems.

No, it's much harder.  Hardware is relatively simple and immutable 
compared to kernel and process state ;)

Yeah, there was a paper, but it looks like the internet has lost it.  It 
was at 
http://www.csu.edu.au/special/conference/apwww95/.papers95/cmaltby/cmaltby.ps
http://www.csu.edu.au/special/conference/apwww95/sept-all.html has 
mention of the paper.
