Hello everyone,

This pull request is much bigger than I had planned on sending.  The
large changes come from patches that Josef Bacik has been refining since
2.6.28 or so, and they include important fixes.

First they change the way we track which extents are free in ram,
significantly reducing slab usage.  Before his code, a weekend stress
run could end up using over 1GB of slab for the free extent records, and
now it is 10MB.

After mount, Btrfs has to read in parts of extent allocation tree to
find free extents.  This can be somewhat slow, leading to long stalls
right after a mount (multiple minutes in the worst case).  Josef has
commits in this pull request that switch us to an async block group
caching, which gets rid of the stalls entirely.

I was planning on leaving these out until 2.6.32, but they work well
and it seems much better to have these issues fixed in .31 than
leaving them pending.  I'd rather not see fc12 need to carry a backport
of this for their .31 based kernels.

There are a number of other bug fixes included, including avoiding some
of the ENOSPC oopsen.
