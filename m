hm, tricky.

I don't know what problems a change like this might cause - probably few,
given the rarity and slowness of block device resizing.

Presumably increasing the device size will cause les problems than
decreasing it would.  Do we even support device shrinking?

I'd have thought that an appropriate way to fix all this would be to
perform the i_size update between freeze_bdev() and thaw_bdev(), when the
fs is quiesced.  But it's not really in my comfort zone.
