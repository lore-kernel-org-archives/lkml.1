Are you saying you would like me to clarify that wording somehow?  It's
meant to be implicit that the arch code is not doing any special fakery
about single-step for signal handlers, only processing real single-step
traps (and faking them for a syscall instruction if the arch requires
that).  No other arch does it, so it didn't occur to me that s390 would.
Before tracehook some had ptrace_notify calls there, and the call to
tracehook_signal_handler replaced that call.

Actually, Oleg rightly points out:

That is quite true, and I just misremembered when writing that paragraph.

So indeed we have been lucky, but it's not the luck of the problem not
happening on s390, but the luck of nobody ever caring. :-)

In short, it is the indication of a signal handler having been set up, just
like its kerneldoc description says.  Whatever that should mean to tracing
(SIGTRAP or otherwise) is in the purview of the generic tracing layer, not
the arch layer.

Correct.


Thanks,
