There are three ordering guarantees:

1. - nothing (for devices with write cache without cache control)

2. - non-cached ordering: the sequence [submit req a, end req a, submit 
req b, end req b] will make the ordering. It is guaranteed that when the 
request ends successfully, it is on medium. This is what all the 
filesystems, md and dm assume about disks. This consistency model was used 
long way before barriers came in.

3. - barrier ordering: ordering is done with barriers, [submit req a, end 
req a, submit req b, end req b] won't guarantee ordering of a and b, a 
barrier must be inserted.

--- so you can make a two bitflags that differentiate these models. In 
current kernel, model (1) and (2) cannot be differentiated in any way. (3) 
can be differentiated only after a trial write and it won't guarantee that 
(3) will be valid further.

If someone implements "write barrier's aren't supported => run fsck", then 
a lot of systems start fscking needlessly (for example those using md or 
dm without write cache) and become inoperational for long time because of 
that. So no one can really implement this logic and filesystems don't run 
fsck at all when operated over a device that doesn't support ordering. So 
you get data corruption if you get crash on those devices.

No.

The barrier can be cancelled with -EOPNOTSUPP at any time. Andi Kleen 
submitted a patch that implements failing barriers for device mapper and 
he says that md-raid1 does the same thing.

Filesystems handle these randomly failed barriers but the downside is that 
they must not submit any request concurrently with the barrier. Also, that 
-EOPNOTSUPP restarting code is really crap, the request cannot be 
restarted from bi_end_io, so bi_end_io needs to handle to another thread 
for retry without barrier.

See this patch: http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/4/433 (and associated thread)
The patch is silly but it just shows what is really hapenning and what the 
filesystem must be prepared to deal with.

I definitelly agree that it shouldn't fail. So remove that -EOPNOTSUPP 
error code at all, make barriers always pass to all kinds of devices and 
inform the caller via queue flags that the device doesn't support 
ordering.
