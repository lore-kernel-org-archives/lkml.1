Auch indeed. That'd probably be better as a

        do {
                ...
        } while (sg != sg_end);

It is, sg_last() should really not be used a lot since it'll leaf
through the entire sg list. People should either keep count of the
number of entries so that they know when they are dealing with the last
valid entry. Or use the for_each_sg() loop helper, if possible.

Drivers are usually very simple, the iommu code does more sg tricks and
thus is more complex to audit.

Agree.
