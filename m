Since 2.6.32 is already out, it's probably a good time (or at least I
shouldn't wait longer!) to talk about 2.6.33 merge plans.
Unfortunately I lost pretty much a week and a half after Thanksgiving
to the flu, so I'm pretty late and didn't get as much done as I hoped.
Anyway, all the pending things that I'm aware of are listed below.

I've merged and pushed out what I plan to merge in my for-next branch,
and everything has cooked a couple of days in -next, so I'll send a
pull request to Linus shortly.

Boilerplate:

If something isn't already in my tree and it isn't listed below, I
probably missed it or dropped it unintentionally.  Please remind me.

As usual, when submitting a patch:

 - Give a good changelog that explains what issue your patch
   addresses, how you address the issue, how serious the issue is, and
   any other information that would be useful to someone evaluating
   your patch or reading it years from now.

 - Please make sure that you include a "Signed-off-by:" line, and put
   any extra junk that should not go into the final kernel log *after*
   the "---" line so that git tools strip it off automatically.  Make
   the subject line be appropriate for inclusion in the kernel log as
   well once the leading "[PATCH ...]" stuff is stripped off.  I waste a
   lot of time fixing patches by hand that could otherwise be spent
   doing something productive like watching youtube.

 - Run your patch through checkpatch.pl so I don't have to nag you to
   fix trivial issues (or spend time fixing them myself).

 - Read your patch over so I don't see a memory leak or deadlock as
   soon as I look at it.

 - Build your patch with sparse checking ("C=2 CF=-D__CHECK_ENDIAN__")
   and make sure it doesn't introduce new warnings.  (A big bonus in
   goodwill for sending patches that fix old warnings)

 - Test your patch on a kernel with things like slab debugging and
   lockdep turned on.

And while you're waiting for me to get to your patch, I sure wouldn't
mind if you read and commented on someone else's patch.  None of this
means you shouldn't remind me about pending patches, since I often
lose track of things and drop them accidentally.

Core:

 - Merged a series improving IPv6 CMA support, with work from David
   Wilder, Jason Gunthorpe and Sean Hefty.

 - Merged a bunch of small fixes from various people, including a
   number found via code analysis.

ULPs:

 - Nothing major -- I think maybe one IPoIB fix and one iSER fix.

HW specific:

 - Merged a series of fixes from Frank Zago to make the error handling
   behavior of various post_send / post_recv implementations more
   consistent.

 - Merged a bunch of fixes and cleanups for the nes driver.  Nice to
   see continuing work to improve the code from Intel.

Here are a few topics that are not ready in time for the 2.6.33 window
and will need to wait for 2.6.34 at least:

 - Userspace MMU notifiers ("ummunotify").  When I requested that this
   be pulled earlier, I got feedback asking me to explore moving the
   userspace ABI to the perf events framework.  I haven't had time to
   do this yet, so things are kind of stalled.  I'm not convinced that
   perf events fit ummunotify particularly well, but we need to see.
   It also might be worth exploring again whether we can define a set
   of semantics tightly enough to do kernel-level MR caching to avoid
   the complications of defining a more general kernel facility.

 - SRP faster failover.  I haven't had a chance to look closely at the
   latest patches.  I still have the feeling that some corner cases
   are not being handled, but the main problem here was my lack of
   time.  If anyone else (Dave Dillow?) wants to weigh in, that would
   be appreciated too.

 - mlx4 SR-IOV support.  Again, main problem was my lack of time.  I
   agree in principle with this stuff, just want to be careful that we
   don't turn the mlx4 driver into an unmaintainable mess of "if
   (sriov) something; else something_else" all over.

 - New QLogic qib driver.  Needs at least one more iteration of
   cleanups; and I have not had time to look at the latest code in
   detail to see exactly what cleanups are needed.  I am concerned
   that QLogic chose to abandon the ipath driver as unmaintainable,
   and now wants to replace it with an even bigger driver (measured
   by lines of code) that does not support the HT device that ipath
   supported.  How can we make sure qib has a longer future?

 - Jack's XRC patch set.  I still need time to work through and clean
   up the code.  I am in the middle of adding reference counting to
   handle sharing XRC domains between processes, and once that is done
   I'll need to merge the mlx4 changes (and hopefully take some of the
   generic reference counting back into the core).  If someone else
   wants to take a stab, that would be fine by me.

 - IBoE.  In principle I think this is starting to get there.  Still
   want to see better ABI compatibility at least, and also make sure
   the interface chosen works for both rdmacm and non-rdmacm
   applications.
