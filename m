  Yes, I meant something like this. We could be more clever and do:

	head = bh = page_buffers(page);
	do {
		wait_on_buffer(bh);
		bh = bh->b_this_page;
	} while (bh != head);
	/*
	 * Now commit code should have been able to proceed and release
         * those buffers
	 */
        schedule();

or we could do simple:
	log_wait_commit(...);

That would impose larger perf. penalty but on the other hand you shouldn't
hit this path too often. But maybe the code above would be fine and would
handle most cases. Also please add a big comment to that function to explain
why this magic is needed.

  Actually, we need .launder_page callback only in data=order mode.
data=writeback mode doesn't need it at all (journal code doesn't touch data
buffers there) and for data=journal mode DIO could have never worked
reasonably when mixed with buffered IO and it would have to do a different
and much more expensive trickery (like flushing the journal, or at least
forcing current transaction to commit).
