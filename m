If that semaphore is being used as a mutex then we should convert it to
a mutex (dammit).

Leaving it implemented as a semphore is not the proper way of
suppressing the lockdep warnings.  It would be better to convert it to
a mutex then add suitable (and suitably commented) open-coded lockdep
annotations to suppress the runtime warnings.

And afaik that's pretty much what your patch did, except you added that
unpopular macro.  If instead of the macro we were to convert that patch
to add open-coded lockdep annotation, what problems remain?
