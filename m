Don't worry about setting the memory invalidate bit, I never worried
about it and
got > 250 MB/sec on a 9550SX using RAID5, with bonnie on 64KB seq writes
using XFS and
12 disks.  Nothing else was on the PCI-X bus.  I suggest you step back
and look at following
 - Run in single user mode to eliminate impact of other things in O/S
 - look at PC architecture and make sure that the PCI-X bus isn't
sharing resources with
   Other things that compete for system resources --  like 1Gbit
ethernet cards that are active
 - look carefully at file system, volume manager, take them out of
equation if it is your goal
   to just benchmark the card.  
 - update the firmware if it isn't current.  I have NDA development deal
with 3WARE/AMCC, and
   you really need to keep up with firmware/driver updates.  They are
always tweaking their algorithms
   for improved performance. 

Gut feeling ... your choice of file system and file system settings is
adding a huge amount of 
overhead, so your 3WARE controller is likely doing a great deal of small
block reads/writes in 
addition to your benchmarking traffic.

I got 300MB/sec on same system when I booted to Windows and used NTFS,
BTW.
So it isn't the card, or the memory invalidate bit.  Look elsewhere.
