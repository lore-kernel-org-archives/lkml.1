Would you like to write up an interface definition description (likely
man page) and post it for review, possibly with a mention of apps using
it today ?

One reason for introducing the mode parameter was to allow the interface to
evolve incrementally as more options / semantic questions are proposed, so
that we don't have to make all the decisions right now. 
So it would be good to start with a *minimal* definition, even just one mode.
The rest could follow as subsequent patches, each being reviewed and debated
separately. Otherwise this discussion can drag on for a long time.
