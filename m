Were you able to modify your writer to do real fsync system calls?  If  
so, did it help?  That would be a useful data point.

NFS uses close-to-open cache coherency.  Thus we expect the file to be  
consistent and up to date after it is opened by a client, but not  
necessarily if some other client writes to it after it was opened.  We  
usually recommend file locking and direct I/O to minimize these  
problems.

Practically speaking this is often not enough for typical  
applications, so NFS client implementations go to further (non- 
standard) efforts to behave like a local file system.  This is simply  
a question of whether we can address this while not creating  
performance or correctness issues for other common use cases.

Anyway, I'm not the NFS client maintainer, so this decision is not up  
to me.
