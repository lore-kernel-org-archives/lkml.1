Sorry for the mail flood. This is the last one and then I'm going to wait for some reactions.

s/clock->error/clock->xtime_nsec/ of course.

Looking a bit closer at what Roman's patch 5cd1c9c5cf30 does, I see this:

-       clock->xtime_nsec += (s64)xtime.tv_nsec << clock->shift;
+       clock->xtime_nsec = (s64)xtime.tv_nsec << clock->shift;
[...]
        clocksource_adjust(offset);
-       xtime.tv_nsec = (s64)clock->xtime_nsec >> clock->shift;
+       xtime.tv_nsec = ((s64)clock->xtime_nsec >> clock->shift) + 1;
        clock->xtime_nsec -= (s64)xtime.tv_nsec << clock->shift;
+       clock->error += clock->xtime_nsec << (NTP_SCALE_SHIFT - clock->shift);

So, in the old situation the code first added xtime.tv_nsec to
clock->xtime_nsec and later subtracted it again, so there's symmetry.

In the new code we no longer do the first, but still do the second. That
seems strange and probably upsets assumptions in the code in between, which
includes the call to clocksource_adjust(). AFAICT this is the root cause of
the overflow visible in my earliest traces.
I've done some tries to correct that, but did not find anything that really
worked.

I also do now know with near certainty where the system hangs with the
vanilla 2.6.28.7: in the 'while (offset >= clock->cycle_interval)' loop in
update_wall_time. That loop should probably have some mechanism to warn if
it's running wild...

This whole code is pretty tricky, but I'm convinced Roman's patch is
structurally broken.

Cheers,
FJP
