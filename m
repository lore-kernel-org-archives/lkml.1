The point is that the compiler is then free to do it. If things
slow down after the compiler gets *more* information, then that
is a problem with the compiler heuristics rather than the
information we give it.

Well most architectures have L1 caches of several cycles. And
L2 miss typically means going to L2 which in some cases the
compiler is expected to attempt to cover as much as possible
(eg in-order architectures).

If the caches are missed completely, then especially with an
in-order architecture, you want to issue as many parallel loads
as possible during the stall. If the compiler can't resolve
aliases, then it simply won't be able to bring some of those
loads forward.

Store queues are, what? On the order of tens of entries for
big power hungry x86? I'd guess much smaller for low power
in-order x86 and ARM etc. These can definitely fill up and
stall, so you still want to get loads out early if possible.

Even a lot of OOOE CPUs I think won't have the best alias
anaysis, so all else being equal, it wouldn't hurt them to
move loads earlier.

I don't think any of this is a reason not to use restrict, though.
But... there are so many places we could add it to the kernel, and
probably so few where it makes much difference. Maybe it should be
able to help some critical core code, though.
