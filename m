It's not that much effort, and for a big database (say, like a 50GB
database file), the indirect blocks would take up 50 megabytes of
memory.  Collapsing it into an extent tree would save that memory into
a few kilobytes.  I suppose a database server would probably have
5-10GB's of memory, so the grand scheme of things it's not a vast
amount of memory, but the trick is keeping the indirect blocks pinned
so they don't get pushed out by some vast, gigunndo Java application
running in the same server as the database.  If you have the indirect
blocks encoded into the extent tree, then you don't have to worry
about that.
