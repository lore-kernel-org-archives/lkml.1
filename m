  Yes, I've recently noted this as well :)

  Yes. Actually, I think there's another bug in there as well - at least
I have bugreport where we obviously miss that writing ordered buffer
failed (I see completion function of the buffer return with eopnotsupp
bit set but barriers aren't disabled). I think someone starts writing
out the buffer before we call sync_dirty_buffer(bh) but I'm not completely
sure who can do this when we just do set_buffer_dirty(bh)... Anyway
before I check that it is indeed happening what I think is happening,
your fix is fine :).
