It's not just an excuse, there are repeatably problems with getting the
block stuff pulled into -mm. Sometimes it's my problem, but not always.
Then I get a note saying that pulling was disabled due to merge
problems, usually right before -mmX goes out. So it misses that release.

With bsg it wasn't a huge issue imho, since it was in fairly good shape
and it the issue were mainly with integration. I do try to make sure
stuff gets tested, but I also know which stuff is more important to get
exposure and multi-user testing on. bsg wasn't one of those, it's just a
lowly driver.
