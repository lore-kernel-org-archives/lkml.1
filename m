VT-d uses a multi-level page-table, so there would be no problem
resizing.

The logic seems pretty simple to me, all we need to do is keep track
of how many entries are currently allocated in the bitmap vs. the size
of the bitmap. Once we get to the half-way point, double the size of
the bitmap. Having said that, I'm not sure it's worth it, and have no
plans to implement it :-)
