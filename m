OK it is only used with GFP_ATOMIC.
Theoretically, what if I use a thread and am aloud to sleep,
(and executing requests in serial). Can I then wait on the first bio_clone.

Are you saying that, in the case I'm a swap device? or do you mean that if I
use the above code I can break it for other devices that are swap-devices
and cause a live lock for them.

Currently the OSD library is not swap safe. And even if it was, iSCSI is not.
So there is no option of this ever been swap.

Do I need to manage such a pool internally and use __bio_clone() or is there
an easy way to associate a private bio-pool to a request_queue?

Is there a system limit to that, that I can be sure of? Or just choose
a magic number and if it is exceeded just split the io up in parts?

osdblk_rq_fn (the queue fn) is it serialized to one thread? If not
could I use the queue lock for the duration of the clone?
