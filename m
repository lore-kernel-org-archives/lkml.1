  In this regard, data=guarded need not be better than data=writeback.
We push out the data in guarded mode as late as in writeback mode
(that's where the performance benefit comes from ;). The difference is
that we increase i_size only after data are safely on disk so we cannot
expose old data.
  So security-wise, guarded mode is as safe as ordered mode but in other
aspects its more like data=writeback.
