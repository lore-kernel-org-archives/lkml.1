  Yeah, we already discussed similar problems I_DIRTY flags with Ted and
others in thread "fsync on ext[34] working only by an accident" on
linux-ext4.
  I don't quite like clearing dirty flags only on sync - pdflush would then
unnecessarily try to get rid of those inodes and burn CPU on them.
Actually, mapping->private_list (and bh->b_assoc_buffers) is meant to be
used exactly for the purpose of tracking what needs to be written on fsync
so my current plan is to somehow utilize that list to fix the problem.
  Maybe I even get to that tomorrow ;) Thanks for the reminder.
