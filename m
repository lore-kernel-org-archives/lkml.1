We need something similar for system containers (like vservers).  We
will likely want root in a container to be confined to a certain set
of devices.

For starters we expect to use the capability bounding sets (see
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/26/206).  So a container will have a static
/dev predefined, and CAP_MKNOD will be removed from its capability
bounding set so that root in a container cannot create any more new
devices.

For future more sophisticated device controls, two similar approaches
have been suggested (one by me, see
https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/containers/2007-September/007423.html
and
https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/containers/2007-November/008589.html
).  Both actually control the devices a process can create period,
rather than trying to control at the filesystem.  And yes, these both
lack the feature in your solution that for instance 'c 1 3' must be
called null, which appears to be the kind of guarantee apparmor likes to
provide.

To use your approach, i guess we would have to use selinux (or tomoyo)
to enforce that devices may only be created under /dev?
