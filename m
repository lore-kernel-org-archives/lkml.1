And here it is.... 

Comments, please.  And Eric, if you have a chance to benchmark this to
see how this patch works out, comparing "barrier=0, "barrier=1", and
"barrier=1,journal_async_commit", as we had discussed earlier on the
ext4, I'd be very much obliged.

As I mentioned earlier, adding blkdev_issue_flush() to ext[34]/fsync.c
is I believe not necessary.  We should be doing the right thing in the
commit.c file.  In the future, if we want some extra bonus points, in
the case where writes have taken place to the inode, but no metadata
operations have taken place (the common case when a database is
writing to a pre-existing tablespace), it would be nice if fsync()
could notice this case, force out the datablocks the old-fashioned way
without forcing an journal commit, and then calling
blkdev_issue_flush().  That should give us some nice performance wins
for database workloads; unfortunately it probably won't do us any good
on mailserver workloads.

Regards,

						- Ted

Subject: [PATCH] ext4: Fix use of write barrier in commit logic

We were previously using set_buffer_ordered() and then calling
submit_bh() to write the commit block, which resulted in this flush
behavior:

write log blocks
blkdev_issue_flush()	// flush #1
write commit block
blkdev_issue_flush()	// flush #2
write metadata blocks

And if the journal_async_commit mount option was used, the commit was
written without using set_buffer_ordered(), which resulted in no
flushes happening at all.

Change the commit code to use blkdev_issue_flush() explicitly, and to
omit flush #1 if journal_async_commit is enabled, but to always
perform the second flush if write barriers are enabled.

This change should hopefully reduce the overhead of using write
barriers when an ext4 filesystem is mounted using
"barrier=1,journal_async_commit", while still maintaining filesystem
safety.  If this works out, we should probably make this the default
mode for ext4.
