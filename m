Let's do it?

Oh, good.  I must have been looking at an old patch.

One the one hand, kthreads are expected to not block and to check for
kthread_should_stop very often, so this wouldn't be a problem.
On the other hand, expectations like this are quickly invalidated, and
the code probably should be fixed.
I suspect we could do without adding anything to task_struct.
Instead of just one kthread_stop_info, have a linked list, one entry
for each thread being stopped at the moment.  kthread_stop adds to
the list, sets PF_EXITING (I hope that is safe) and wakes the process.
kthread_should_stop tests PF_EXITING.
When kthread() finishes, it does a linear search (the list should be
short) and calls complete and the relevant .done.

Something like this?
