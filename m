The thing is that M2 is not a copy of M1. When updating M2 for data-B, the
procedure is not "copy M1, update sector-B's checksum, write" but "read M2,
update sector-B's checksum, write". So as long as there are no writes to
sector-A, M1 will have the incorrect checksum and M2 will have the correct
one, regardless of writes to the other sectors.

However, a troubling scenario based on yours could be:

 - M2 has the right checksum but is older, M1 has the wrong checksum but is
   newer.
 - user writes data-A'' to sector'A
 - queue up write for M2 (chosen because it is older)
 - M2 is written correctly
 - power fails before data-A'' is written

At that point, data-A is written at sector-A, but both M1 and M2 have
incorrect checksums for it.

I'll try to come up with a better scheme that copes with this kind of
scenarios and post an updated patch.

Thanks a lot,
