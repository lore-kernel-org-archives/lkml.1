Subject: [PATCH 004 of 5] md: Allow reshape_position for md arrays to be set via sysfs.
References: <20070508142718.28571.patches@notabene>
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org


"reshape_position" records how much progress has been made on a
"reshape" (adding drives, changing layout or chunksize).

When it is set, the number of drives, layout and chunksize can have
two possible values, an old an a new.

So allow these different values to be visible, and allow both old and
new to be set:  Set the old ones first, then the reshape_position,
then the new values.
