Bringing this back to a wider audience.  I provided the full sysrq
trace of the RHEL5 kernel to Neil; in it we saw that md0_raid1 had the
following trace:

To take this further I've now collected a full sysrq trace of this
hang on a SLES10 SP1 RC5 2.6.16.46-0.12-smp kernel, the relevant
md0_raid1 trace is comparable to the RHEL5 trace from above:

Taking a step back, here is what was done to reproduce on SLES10:
1) establish a raid1 mirror (md0) using one local member (sdc1) and
one remote member (nbd0)
2) power off the remote machine, whereby severing nbd0's connection
3) perform IO to the filesystem that is on the md0 device to enduce
the MD layer to mark the nbd device as "faulty"
4) cat /proc/mdstat hangs, sysrq trace was collected and showed the
above md0_raid1 trace.

To be clear, the MD superblock update hangs indefinitely on RHEL5.
But with SLES10 it eventually succeeds (and MD marks the nbd0 member
faulty); and the other tasks that were blocking waiting for the MD
lock (e.g. 'cat /proc/mdstat') then complete immediately.

It should be noted that this MD+NBD configuration has worked
flawlessly using a stock kernel.org 2.6.15.7 kernel (ontop of a
RHEL4U4 distro).  Steps have not been taken to try to reproduce  with
2.6.15.7 on SLES10; it may be useful to pursue but I'll defer to
others to suggest I do so.

2.6.15.7 does not have the SMP race fixes that were made in 2.6.16;
yet both SLES10 and RHEL5 kernels do:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=4b2f0260c74324abca76ccaa42d426af163125e7

If not this specific NBD change, something appears to have changed
with how NBD behaves in the face of it's connection to the server
being lost.  Almost like the MD superblock update that would be
written to nbd0 is blocking within nbd or the network layer because of
a network timeout issue?

I will try to get a better understanding of what is _really_ happening
with systemtap; but others' suggestions/insight is very welcome.

regards,
Mike
