Extending this view in the context of security - we can require sysadmin
privilege to restart, and then sysadmin is responsible for the contents
of the file. The kernel will ensure the the data isn't corrupted. Much
like with loading a kenrel module - the admin may load any sort of crap.
Then, sysadmin may, for instance, add a signature on a checkpointed file
to verify it's integrity.

(Well, one problem with this scheme in the context of self-checkpoint
would be - who can be trusted to generate the signature in that case).

Using a single handle (crid or a special file descriptor) to identify
the whole checkpoint is very useful - to be able to stream it (eg. over
the network, or through filters). It is also very important for future
features and optimizations. For example, to reduce downtime of the
application during checkpoint, one can use COW for dirty pages, and
only write-back the entire data after the application resumes execution.
Or imagine a use-case where one would like to keep the entire checkpoint
in memory. These are pretty hard to do if you split the handling between
multiple files or handles.

This is an interesting idea but not without its problems. In particular,
a successful execve() by one thread destroys all the others. Also, it
isn't clear how this can work with pre-copying and live-migration; And
finally, I'm not sure how to handle shared objects in this manner.

As for kernel module - it is easy to implement most of the checkpoint
restart functionality in a kernel module, leaving only the syscall stubs
in the kernel.
