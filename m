Bug reports against a 3-6 months old snapshot of a filesystem being 
under heavy development.

Ted said back in August in the announcement of an ext4 patchset:

"As before I've also released updated the patch set vs. the 2.6.26 stock
 kernel, for those people who don't want to play with development 
 kernels but who still want to test out ext4." [1]

When running stable kernels you still have to patch, build and install
a single purpose kernel for testing ext4 although ext4 is in mainline.

There are lies, damn lies, and statistics.  ;)

Single day statistics about mailing list postings are not very good
indicators for anything.

And since linux-ext4 is for all of ext2/ext3/ext4 the data you gave 
could equally be used to prove that ext3 recently became much more
buggy or that ext2 development vastly increased...

Regarding users see my comment above.

Regarding developers it would be interesting to hear some experiences 
from ext4 developers about their experiences (or get a pointer to them 
in case I missed that they already expressed it somewhere).

2 years ago ext4 was in a similar situation of being regarded as an 
important future filesystem.

BTW: My comments are not in any way meant against btrfs or ext4.
     I just question the advantages of merging them early.
