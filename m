That is either a problem or a solution, depending which bad behavior you

I'm not really sure what you're getting at here, I use grub in MBR and 
then add chain loader stanzas to grub.conf for many things, usually an 
alternate Linux release, or to have 32/64 of the same release handy for 
testing, and always memtest from the boot menu. Even Win98SP2 on one 
machine, since that works very poorly under KVM. (ask Avi if you care 
why, something about what it does in real mode). In any case, I don't 
see the chain loader issue, unless you mean to reboot out of some other 
OS into Linux.
