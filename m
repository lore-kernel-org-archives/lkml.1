No problem, I'm not exactly able to reproduce it myself, but Jan Kara
has just fixed some issues which could explain it: they happen under
memory pressure so I may not have triggered it if I didn't put it
under pressure.

Jan's fixes are here:

http://marc.info/?l=linux-ext4&m=123731584711382&w=2

It would be interesting to try them, and if they don't work maybe
he's also interested so I cc'ed him.

It's possible the real block device is not fast enough to trigger
it, or different timings don't trigger it (brd requests complete
immediately wheras real devices tend to complete afterwards,
from (soft)interrupt context). 

Or it could be that brd is consuming some more memory to push
the system into reclaim and exposing those bugs Jan has fixed...

Yes, thanks for persisting. If you can test the patches and see
if they help? If not, does ext2 show corruption? How about ext3
on loop device (with backing file from tmpfs/ramfs for speed).

Thanks,
Nick
