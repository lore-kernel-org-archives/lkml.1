This detection was not happening but then again the proper driver was not
compiled. The .config I used was very minimal and lacked most drivers.

It's included below. Earlier I said this was not on an ISA bus. This belief
was enforced by CONFIG_ISA not being necessary for ide-generic to work in
the past and the fact lspci lists the device. However, lspci does call it
"PIIX4 ISA (rev 02)" so maybe I was getting that wrong too.

It is certainly the case I was not using the correct driver. Using
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX instead of CONFIG_IDE_GENERIC makes everything work as
expected without having to pass special options.
