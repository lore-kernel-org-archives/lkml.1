How so?  Why not unlink the target from the host's list when the 
device_del() call returns?  A new target can be created any time after 
that, since the old one is now completely invisible.

No, not if the old target is removed from the host's list before the
new target is added.

Is there any reason the old target has to remain on the list?  If 
there is, we can introduce a new state: STARGET_CLEANUP.  The old 
target gets put into this state when device_del() returns.  List 
entries in that state are ignored by __scsi_find_target() or whatever 
else looks through the list.

P.S.: Does scsi_target_reap() really ever get called in non-process
context?  I couldn't find any place where that might happen.
