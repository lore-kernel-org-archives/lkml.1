I think I finally have an idea that will work. (`bout time!) We actually
have 2 different issues. One is that there may outstanding commands on
the controller when the kdump kernel initializes. Our SAS controllers
support the reset message defined in the open CISS spec which will
(hopefully) resolve this issue. The second problem is that I cannot
allocate my MSI-X vectors because I couldn't free the vectors then
disable MSI. So the cciss driver would most likely panic at that time.
My idea for this is to put the card into INTx mode rather than MSI or
MSI-X. That should the 2nd issue.
I haven't tested the 64xx series to see if they support the reset
message. I should to write the code today, maybe test by tomorrow and
then send something upstream.
