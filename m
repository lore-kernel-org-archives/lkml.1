I happen to be working on sysfs these days and guess why I started
working on sysfs. :-)

Disassociating sysfs from driver model is probably one or two patchsets
away.  It could have happened earlier but I wanted to pace things a bit
so that the changes receive some testing through release cycles.  Check
how many sysfs related changes went through .23-rc1 merge window and
expect about the same influx during the next cycle; with some luck, it
can be complete before .24-rc1 window.

I don't necessarily want to but delaying it might be the right thing to
do.  Anyways, if we're going to do an interim solution, I don't think
mainline SCSI sysfs hierarchy is the right place.  Do it with module
parameter which carries large "to be deprecated sign" or maintain out of
tree patches.

This is gonna be a bit long.  Please be patient.

Due to the generosity of the ATA committee, we have, by default, at
least two ways to achieve link PS - HIPS and DIPS.  I dunno why but
someone thought we needed two.  And then, ahci people thought automatic
HIPS would be nice, which I fully agree, and added ALPM.  Unfortunately,
they mandated ALPM to kick in the moment command engine becomes idle, so
most current implementations suffer unnecessary performance hit when
ALPM is active.

We have this crazy number of combinations.  HIPS, DIPS,
not-so-hot-looking ALPM and probably some number of broken devices which
may be happy with some method but not with others.  Some might be happy
with PARTIAL but vomit on SLUMBER.  I might be being too pessimistic but
my last two years in IDE/ATA land taught me to be pessimistic about
hardware quality.  Heck, I bet you some of non-intel ahci
implementations which claim to support ALPM will crap themselves when
actually told to do so.

If we're gonna do this like NCQ and gonna put knowledge about all the
combinations into the driver.  The suggested interface is good enough.
Heck, we probably don't even need three levels.  On and off should be
enough if things are done right as link PS doesn't have to incur
noticeable performance degradation.  But to do that, we'll need to test
a lot of combinations and it's gonna be much harder than NCQ (some ahci
implementations don't seem to actually enter PS mode when instructed to
do so via SControl but turning off the controller saves a lot of power.
 Maybe ALPM works better on such cases) and the blacklist will probably
be longer.

The alternate way is to export flexible interface to userland and let
userland decide and if we're gonna do that.  SCSI sysfs just isn't the
place.

Thanks.
