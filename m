percpu_counter_read() was irq-safe.  That changes here.  Needs careful
review, changelogging and, preferably, runtime checks.  But perhaps
they should be inside some CONFIG_thing which won't normally be done in
production.

otoh, percpu_counter_read() is in fact a rare operation, so a bit of
overhead probably won't matter.

(write-often, read-rarely is the whole point.  This patch's changelog's
assertion that "Since fbc->count is read more frequently and updated
rarely" is probably wrong.  Most percpu_counters will have their
fbc->count modified far more frequently than having it read from).

yup.

Sure.  I _expect_ that this interface change won't actually break
anything.  But it adds a restriction which we should think about, and
document.



btw, what the heck is percpu_counter_init_irq()?  Some mysterious
lockdep-specific thing?

<does git-fiddle.  Oh.  crappy changelog.>

I let that one leak through uncommented.  Must be getting old. 
Probably it will need an EXPORT_SYMBOL() sometime.


I expect that if we're going to go ahead and make percpu_counter_read()
no longer usable from interrupt context then we'll eventually end up
needing the full suite of _irq() and _irqsave() interface functions. 
percpu_counter_add_irqsave(), etc.
