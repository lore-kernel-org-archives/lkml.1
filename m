no-no, this isn't required. we only need to mark pages/blocks within
transaction, otherwise race is possible when we allocate blocks in transaction,
then transacton starts to commit, then we mark pages/blocks to be flushed
before commit.

no need to allocate space within commit thread, I think. only to take care
of the race I described above. in hackish version of data=ordered for delayed
allocation I used counter of submitted bio's with newly-allocated blocks and
commit thread waits for the counter to reach 0.
