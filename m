Another unquantified very small number.

You have a UPS, but the first time you discover it's not wired up
properly is when it fails.

This happened recently in a customer's office...  The UPS power wiring
melted, leaving a big stinking hole, and all the servers went down -
quickly.

Another is misconfiguring the UPS daemon so it continues writing to
disk for 30 minutes until the battery runs down...

Like the chance of two disks going wrong in a RAID at the same
time... that would *never* happen would it?
