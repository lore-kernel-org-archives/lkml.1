By the "mid-layer" I assume you mean the generic target mode engine, and
not the SCSI mid layer, yes..?

Point taken however that $TARGET_MOD could, and probably should have
some manner of generic ACL infrastructure available through FABRIC <->
TARGET API.  I will have a look at scst_register() and
scst_register_session() and see where it should be adapted to
target_core_mod.

Btw, saying that "management of all security stuff should be purely duty
of the mid-layer" is incorrect however.  The generic target engine needs
to make it *EASIER* for $FABRIC to allow those initiator ports access to
Mapped LUNs through fabric *DEPENDENT* endpoints, but trying to put all
fabric depepdent ACL endpoint logic in target_core_mod is IMHO a bad
idea.  

Since each SCSI fabric's method of attaching SCSI LUN to Initiator Port
Endpoints in $FABRIC_MOD to SCSI Device (I have been calling
this /sys/kernel/config/target/core/$STORAGE_OBJECT for target_core_mod)
to create the SCSI Target Port is different.  The reference I use for
iscsi_target_mod (and hence wrt target_core_mod) is proper T10/SCSI
terminlogy AFAIK.  Lets reference the objects in
http://www.haifa.il.ibm.com/satran/ips/EddyQuicksall-iSCSI-in-diagrams/portal_groups.pdf 
for the discussion so we can make sure we are on the same page..

For example, just because iSCSI uses TargetName + TargetPortalGroupTag
to attach target_core_mod's $STORAGE_OBJECTs at iSCSI Logical Units to,
does not mean that SAS, or another SCSI based target fabric know
anything about TargetName or TargetPortalGroupTag.  In iSCSI, this is
defined in Section 2.1: 

     The I_T nexus can be identified by the conjunction of the SCSI port
     names; that is, the I_T nexus identifier is the tuple (iSCSI
     Initiator Name + ',i,'+ ISID, iSCSI Target Name + ',t,'+ Portal 
     Group Tag).

Obviously the Initiator and Target Ports wrt iSCSI fabric are more
"symbolic" than devices attached to say a legacy Parallel SCSI bus
because of IP storage having multiple IP network portals across multiple
independent backbone providers and subnets (if you are using MC/S or
SCTP), etc, etc.  This is this reason I think it does not make sense to
try to locate fabric dependent ACLs
under /sys/kernel/config/target/core/$STORAGE_OBJECT.  

The type of things that need to be under $STORAGE_OBJECT, and that do
have a direct effect for $FABRIC mapped LUN endpoints are things like
device_type, max_sectors, sector_size, queue_depth and global READ-ONLY.
Of course, we want to be able to see *ALL* of
the /sys/kernel/config/target/$FABRIC dependent ACLs that have been
symlinked to said $STORAGE_OBJECT (this is one of the items on my list,
but not implemented in my current work).

At registration, I assume you mean admin wants to add an endpoint ACL
for a Initiator Port through $FABRIC/endpoint through $FABRIC_MOD..?

I am not sure what "corresponding configfs headaches" you have in mind,
but please be specific and I will address them. :-)

I did address point above in my work, and my commits
under /sys/kernel/config/target/iscsi implement how I get around the
PAGE_SIZE limitiations, which was something that I ran into (moving from
IOCTL and all, which requires overly complex kernel level information
code to get lots of output), to using ConfigFS, which has the same as
procfs and sysfs limits that you need to use seq_file() for > PAGE_SIZE.
Anyways, I did not end up using seq_file() for iscsi_target_mod current
configfs code, here is what I am using to address your above example wrt
getting all of session output:

This ended up being `cat $FABRIC/iqn*/tpgt*/acls/*/info` to view all of
the active iSCSI Sessions on all iSCSI Target fabric endpoints..

The point is that regardless of kernel <-> user information output
method, it makes sense to break up large pieces of kernel level
information code and rely upon access through the VFS and cat to obtain
bulk output.

However, Joel has discussed removing the > PAGE_SIZE limitation for all
of the virtual filesystems, so I am sure he would be more than happy to
take a  patch that addressed your concern if it is really that big of a
deal for the SCSI control path.  With my current work with
target_core_mod and iscsi_target_mod wrt configfs I am not running into
this problem, so me producing this patch is not very high on my list..

Ok, I ended up using a slightly different model for ACLs
under /sys/kernel/config/target/iscsi that the one I mentioned from last
week to get things up and running.  I will be posting the commit and
info shortly.

Thanks for your comments Vlad!
