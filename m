You mean this case?

                } else if (inode->i_state & I_DIRTY) {
                        /*
                         * Someone redirtied the inode while were writing back
                         * the pages.
                         */
                        redirty_tail(inode);
                } else if (atomic_read(&inode->i_count)) {

Sure we can replace the redirty_tail() with requeue_io_wait().

OK, wait a minute...
