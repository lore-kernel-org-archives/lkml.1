Very interesting. I hadn't heard of SIGLOST before, but it does seem
like something we should implement. CIFS might also be able to use it
too. CIFS doesn't have a grace period, so lock reclaims are always
iffy...

While we're on the subject of signals...

Do you have any thoughts/objections to just making the reclaimer thread
ignore them altogether? That would simplify the code a bit.

I think I may have been wrong before as well. Now that I look closer,
I'm not sure that we're actually leaking memory if the reclaimer is
signaled. The file_locks do end up not being on the h_granted list
anymore, but I think that just keeps the kernel from attempting to
reclaim them again (for instance, if a new reclaimer thread is spawned
after this one exits).
