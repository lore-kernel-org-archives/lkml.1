There's some timing coincidence there, but it's a full 1/2 second between
the ext4 error and the DMAR fault (and there's various DMAR faults
along the way for the same buffer before and after the ext4 error).
That fault is quite typical of a driver bug, and it's the VGA device
(rather its driver) that is culpable.  The IOMMU caught the VGA device
trying to do a DMA write to a buffer mapped r/o.

I do use it every day on my primary workstation (x200), and haven't
had any issue (I'm using ext3).

It should be for your adapter (after 66a4fe0c merged in agp fixes).
While it could still be broken (aside of the initial faults before the
device is even initialized in Linux -- I'm not seeing any faults, btw),
iommu=pt will put all devices in a 1:1 mapped domain and would suppress
the DMAR faults you see (similar to intel_iommu=off, but allowing the
iommu to still be used for pci device assignment).  However, doing that
or enabling the gfx workaround would allow the device to generate invalid
DMA requests since if effectively disables the IOMMU for the gfx device,
which would leave a better opportunity for DMA related corruption.
The earlier fs issues we saw w/ the IOMMU were when it was actively
blocking disk DMA requests, but that's not happening here.
