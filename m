  Yes :) That's basically what we told KDE developpers when they were
complaining ;) But it's hard to fix it for them too (because of some
desktop specs requiring lots of different text config files which can
change anytime - don't ask me who designed it). Moreover for example for
loading shared libraries from which you need just a few blocks scattered
all over the place the problem is in ELF itself.
  I'll probably first write some userspace fs-reorganizer to find out how
much these changes in layout are able to give you in performance (i.e.
whether it's worth the effort of more complicated kernel online
defragmenter).
