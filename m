Why not?  I'd say an oops is a problem.  :-)

Such as this?

(Which reminds me...  Are the calls in wait_scan_init() really enough?  
wait_for_device_probe() does async_synchronize_full() and then
scsi_complete_async_scans() finishes the SCSI scanning.  But if this
scanning involves calling sd_probe(), then more async work will be
queued.  Maybe a second call to wait_for_device_probe() is needed.)

There's still more; the patch above isn't sufficient.  What happens if
the "device_add(&sdkp->dev)" call in sd_probe_async() fails?  Then in
sd_remove(), sdkp will be NULL and &sdkp->dev will be meaningless.  The 
device_del() call will crash and the actual scsi_disk structure will be 
leaked.  This could be fixed by moving the dev_set_drvdata() call from 
the end of sd_probe_async() back into sd_probe(), but then we'd find 
sd_remove trying to unregister a device which was never successfully 
registered.

And why is it that the "out_free_index:" code in sd_probe() acquires 
sd_index_lock but the corresponding code in sd_probe_async() doesn't?
