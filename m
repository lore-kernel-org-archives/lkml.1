Yeah, and AFAICT glibc leaves them behind ATM.

We can't simply walk the range an remove unwritten extents, as some
of them may have been present before the fallocate() call. That
makes it extremely difficult to undo a failed call and not remove
more pre-existing pre-allocations.

Given the current behaviour for posix_fallocate() in glibc, I think
that retaining the same error semantic and punting the cleanup to
userspace (where the app will fail with ENOSPC anyway) is the only
sane thing we can do here. Trying to undo this in the kernel leads
to lots of extra rarely used code in error handling paths...

Cheers,

Dave.
