Hi Linus,

Please pull from the "for-2.6.31" branch of the repository at

   git pull git://git.linux-nfs.org/projects/trondmy/nfs-2.6.git for-2.6.31

This will update the following files through the appended changesets.

Most of the changsets are to do with adding support for the NFSv4.1 protocol.
As in the case of the server code, we'd like to move client development into
the mainline tree to allow increased testing and developer participation.
The bulk of the NFSv4.1 code is compiled out as long as you don't define
the CONFIG_V4_1 Kconfig option (which is marked as 'DEVELOPER ONLY').

Interoperability testing against other vendor implementations was done last
week at the NFSv4.1 Bakeathon event in Sunnyvale, and all known problems
have been patched.

This series does not include the NFS private namespace mount fixes, which
depend on a couple of VFS fixes, and will thus be sent separately.

  Cheers,
    Trond

    NFS: More "sloppy" parsing problems
    
    Specifying "port=-5" with the kernel's current mount option parser
    generates "unrecognized mount option".  If "sloppy" is set, this
    causes the mount to succeed and use the default values; the desired
    behavior is that, since this is a valid option with an invalid value,
    the mount should fail, even with "sloppy."
    
    To properly handle "sloppy" parsing, we need to distinguish between
    correct options with invalid values, and incorrect options.  We will
    need to parse integer values by hand, therefore, and not rely on
    match_token().
    
    For instance, these must all fail with "invalid value":
    
    	port=12345678
    	port=-5
    	port=samuel
    
    and not with "unrecognized option," as they do currently.
    
    Thus, for the sake of match_token() we need to treat the values for
    these options as strings, and do the conversion to integers using
    strict_strtol().
    
    This is basically the same solution we used for the earlier "retry="
    fix (commit ecbb3845), except in this case the kernel actually has to
    parse the value, rather than ignore it.

    NFS: Invalid mount option values should always fail, even with "sloppy"
    
    Ian Kent reports:
    
    "I've noticed a couple of other regressions with the options vers
    and proto option of mount.nfs(8).
    
    The commands:
    
    mount -t nfs -o vers=<invalid version> <server>:/<path> /<mountpoint>
    mount -t nfs -o proto=<invalid proto> <server>:/<path> /<mountpoint>
    
    both immediately fail.
    
    But if the "-s" option is also used they both succeed with the
    mount falling back to defaults (by the look of it).
    
    In the past these failed even when the sloppy option was given, as
    I think they should. I believe the sloppy option is meant to allow
    the mount command to still function for mount options (for example
    in shared autofs maps) that exist on other Unix implementations but
    aren't present in the Linux mount.nfs(8). So, an invalid value
    specified for a known mount option is different to an unknown mount
    option and should fail appropriately."

    Introduce an xdr_stream-based XDR decoder that can unpack the auth-

    The nfs_mount() function's caller allocates an array, and passes the

    into the array, and returns the number of decoded flavors.
    
    If the caller is not interested in the auth flavors, it can pass a
    value of zero as the size of the pre-allocated array.

    NFS: Add separate mountd status code decoders for each mountd version
    
    Introduce data structures and xdr_stream-based decoding functions for
    unmarshalling mountd status codes properly.
    
    Mountd version 3 uses specific standard error return codes that are
    not errno values and not NFS3ERR_ values.  These have a well-defined
    standard mapping to local errno values.  Introduce data structures
    and a decoder function that map these status codes to local errno
    values properly.  This is new functionality (but not used yet).
    
    Version 1 mountd status values are defined by RFC 1094 as UNIX error
    values (errno values).  Errno values on heterogeneous systems do not
    necessarily match each other.  To avoid exposing possibly incorrect
    errno values to upper layers, the current XDR decoder converts all
    non-zero MNT version 1 status codes to -EACCES.
    
    The OpenGroup XNFS standard provides a mapping similar to but smaller
    than the version 3 error codes.  Implement a decoder that uses the XNFS
    error codes, replacing the current decoder.
    
    For both mountd protocol versions, map unrecognized errors to -EACCES.
    
    Finally we introduce a replacement data structure for mnt_fhstatus
    at this time, which is used by the new XDR decoders.  In addition to
    documenting that the status value returned by the XDR decoders is
    always an errno, this new structure will be expanded in subsequent
    patches.

    lockd: Update NSM state from SM_MON replies
    
    When rpc.statd starts up in user space at boot time, it attempts to
    write the latest NSM local state number into
    /proc/sys/fs/nfs/nsm_local_state.
    
    If lockd.ko isn't loaded yet (as is the case in most configurations),
    that file doesn't exist, thus the kernel's NSM state remains set to
    its initial value of zero during lockd operation.
    
    This is a problem because rpc.statd and lockd use the NSM state number
    to prevent repeated lock recovery on rebooted hosts.  If lockd sends
    a zero NSM state, but then a delayed SM_NOTIFY with a real NSM state
    number is received, there is no way for lockd or rpc.statd to
    distinguish that stale SM_NOTIFY from an actual reboot.  Thus lock
    recovery could be performed after the rebooted host has already
    started reclaiming locks, and those locks will be lost.
    
    We could change /etc/init.d/nfslock so it always modprobes lockd.ko
    before starting rpc.statd.  However, if lockd.ko is ever unloaded
    and reloaded, we are back at square one, since the NSM state is not
    preserved across an unload/reload cycle.  This may happen frequently
    on clients that use automounter.  A period of NFS inactivity causes
    lockd.ko to be unloaded, and the kernel loses its NSM state setting.
    
    Instead, let's use the fact that rpc.statd plants the local system's
    NSM state in every SM_MON (and SM_UNMON) reply.  lockd performs a
    synchronous SM_MON upcall to the local rpc.statd _before_ sending its
    first NLM request to a new remote.  This would permit rpc.statd to
    provide the current NSM state to lockd, even after lockd.ko had been
    unloaded and reloaded.
    
    Note that NLMPROC_LOCK arguments are constructed before the
    nsm_monitor() call, so we have to rearrange argument construction very
    slightly to make this all work out.
    
    And, the kernel appears to treat NSM state as a u32 (see struct
    nlm_args and nsm_res).  Make nsm_local_state a u32 as well, to ensure
    we don't get bogus comparison results.

    NFS: add support for splice writes
    
    Adds support for splice writes. It effectively calls
    generic_file_splice_write() to do the writes.
    
    We need not worry about O_APPEND case as the combination of splice()
    writes and O_APPEND is disallowed. This patch propagates NFS write
    errors back to the caller. The number of bytes written via splice are
    being added to NFSIO_NORMALWRITTENBYTES as these are effectively
    cached writes.

    nfs41: Implement NFSv4.1 callback service process.
    
    nfs41_callback_up() initializes the necessary queues and creates the new
    nfs41_callback_svc thread.  This thread executes the callback service which
    waits for requests to arrive on the svc_serv->sv_cb_list.
    
    NFS41_BC_MIN_CALLBACKS is set to 1 because we expect callbacks to not
    cause substantial latency.
    
    The actual processing of the callback will be implemented as a separate patch.
    
    There is only one NFSv4.1 callback service.  The first caller of
    nfs4_callback_up() creates the service, subsequent callers increment a
    reference count on the service.  The service is destroyed when the last
    caller invokes nfs_callback_down().
    
    The transport needs to hold a reference to the callback service in order
    to invoke it during callback processing.  Currently this reference is only
    obtained when the service is first created.  This is incorrect, since
    subsequent registrations for other transports will leave the xprt->serv
    pointer uninitialized, leading to an oops when a callback arrives on
    the "unreferenced" transport.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by ensuring that a reference to the service
    is saved in xprt->serv, either because the service is created by this
    invocation to nfs4_callback_up() or by a prior invocation.

    nfs41: Add backchannel processing support to RPC state machine
    
    Adds rpc_run_bc_task() which is called by the NFS callback service to
    process backchannel requests.  It performs similar work to rpc_run_task()
    though "schedules" the backchannel task to be executed starting at the
    call_trasmit state in the RPC state machine.
    
    It also introduces some miscellaneous updates to the argument validation,
    call_transmit, and transport cleanup functions to take into account
    that there are now forechannel and backchannel tasks.
    
    Backchannel requests do not carry an RPC message structure, since the
    payload has already been XDR encoded using the existing NFSv4 callback
    mechanism.
    
    Introduce a new transmit state for the client to reply on to backchannel
    requests.  This new state simply reserves the transport and issues the
    reply.  In case of a connection related error, disconnects the transport and
    drops the reply.  It requires the forechannel to re-establish the connection
    and the server to retransmit the request, as stated in NFSv4.1 section
    2.9.2 "Client and Server Transport Behavior".
    
    Note: There is no need to loop attempting to reserve the transport.  If EAGAIN

    NFSv4: Handle more errors when recovering open file and locking state
    
    It is possible for servers to return NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID when
    the state management code is recovering locks or is reclaiming state when
    returning a delegation. Ensure that we handle that case.
    While we're at it, add in handlers for NFS4ERR_STALE,
    NFS4ERR_ADMIN_REVOKED, NFS4ERR_OPENMODE, NFS4ERR_DENIED and
    NFS4ERR_STALE_STATEID, since the protocol appears to allow for them too.
    
    Also handle ENOMEM...
    
    Finally, rather than add new NFSv4.0-specific errors and error handling into
    the generic delegation code, move that open file and locking state error
    handling into the NFSv4 layer.

    nfs41: New xs_tcp_read_data()
    
    Handles RPC replies and backchannel callbacks.  Traditionally the NFS
    client has expected only RPC replies on its open connections.  With
    NFSv4.1, callbacks can arrive over an existing open connection.
    
    This patch refactors the old xs_tcp_read_request() into an RPC reply handler:
    xs_tcp_read_reply(), a new backchannel callback handler: xs_tcp_read_callback(),
    and a common routine to read the data off the transport: xs_tcp_read_common().
    The new xs_tcp_read_callback() queues callback requests onto a queue where
    the callback service (a separate thread) is listening for the processing.
    
    This patch incorporates work and suggestions from Rahul Iyer (iyer@netapp.com)
    and Benny Halevy (bhalevy@panasas.com).
    
    xs_tcp_read_callback() drops the connection when the number of expected
    callbacks is exceeded.  Use xprt_force_disconnect(), ensuring tasks on
    the pending queue are awaken on disconnect.

    nfs41: New backchannel helper routines
    
    This patch introduces support to setup the callback xprt on the client side.
    It allocates/ destroys the preallocated memory structures used to process
    backchannel requests.
    
    At setup time, xprt_setup_backchannel() is invoked to allocate one or
    more rpc_rqst structures and substructures.  This ensures that they
    are available when an RPC callback arrives.  The rpc_rqst structures
    are maintained in a linked list attached to the rpc_xprt structure.
    We keep track of the number of allocations so that they can be correctly
    removed when the channel is destroyed.
    
    When an RPC callback arrives, xprt_alloc_bc_request() is invoked to
    obtain a preallocated rpc_rqst structure.  An rpc_xprt structure is
    returned, and its RPC_BC_PREALLOC_IN_USE bit is set in
    rpc_xprt->bc_flags.  The structure is removed from the the list
    since it is now in use, and it will be later added back when its
    user is done with it.
    
    After the RPC callback replies, the rpc_rqst structure is returned
    by invoking xprt_free_bc_request().  This clears the
    RPC_BC_PREALLOC_IN_USE bit and adds it back to the list, allowing it
    to be reused by a subsequent RPC callback request.
    
    To be consistent with the reception of RPC messages, the backchannel requests
    should be placed into the 'struct rpc_rqst' rq_rcv_buf, which is then in turn
    copied to the 'struct rpc_rqst' rq_private_buf.

    Adds new list of rpc_xprt structures, and a readers/writers lock to
    protect the list.  The list is used to preallocate resources for
    the backchannel during backchannel requests.  Callbacks are not
    expected to cause significant latency, so only one callback will
    be allowed at this time.
    
    It also adds a pointer to the NFS callback service so that
    requests can be directed to it for processing.
    
    New callback members added to svc_serv. The NFSv4.1 callback service will
    sleep on the svc_serv->svc_cb_waitq until new callback requests arrive.
    The request will be queued in svc_serv->svc_cb_list. This patch adds this
    list, the sleep queue and spinlock to svc_serv.

    nfs41: Process the RPC call direction
    
    Reading and storing the RPC direction is a three step process.
    
    1. xs_tcp_read_calldir() reads the RPC direction, but it will not store it
    in the XDR buffer since the 'struct rpc_rqst' is not yet available.
    
    2. The 'struct rpc_rqst' is obtained during the TCP_RCV_COPY_DATA state.
    This state need not necessarily be preceeded by the TCP_RCV_READ_CALLDIR.
    For example, we may be reading a continuation packet to a large reply.
    Therefore, we can't simply obtain the 'struct rpc_rqst' during the
    TCP_RCV_READ_CALLDIR state and assume it's available during TCP_RCV_COPY_DATA.
    
    This patch adds a new TCP_RCV_READ_CALLDIR flag to indicate the need to
    read the RPC direction.  It then uses TCP_RCV_COPY_CALLDIR to indicate the
    RPC direction needs to be saved after the 'struct rpc_rqst' has been allocated.
    
    3. The 'struct rpc_rqst' is obtained by the xs_tcp_read_data() helper
    functions.  xs_tcp_read_common() then saves the RPC direction in the XDR
    buffer if TCP_RCV_COPY_CALLDIR is set.  This will happen when we're reading
    the data immediately after the direction was read.  xs_tcp_read_common()
    then clears this flag.

    nfs41: Add ability to read RPC call direction on TCP stream.
    
    NFSv4.1 callbacks can arrive over an existing connection. This patch adds
    the logic to read the RPC call direction (call or reply). It does this by
    updating the state machine to look for the call direction invoking
    xs_tcp_read_calldir(...) after reading the XID.
    
    [nfs41: Keep track of RPC call/reply direction with a flag]
    
    As per 11/14/08 review of RFC 53/85.
    
    Add a new flag to track whether the incoming message is an RPC call or an
    RPC reply.  TCP_RPC_REPLY is set in the 'struct sock_xprt' tcp_flags in
    xs_tcp_read_calldir() if the message is an RPC reply sent on the forechannel.
    It is cleared if the message is an RPC request sent on the back channel.

    nfs41: schedule async session reset
    
    Define a new session reset state which is set upon a sequence operation error
    in both the sync and async error handlers.
    
    Place all new requests and all but the last outstanding rpc on the
    slot_tbl_waitq. Spawn the recovery thread when the last slot is free.
    Call nfs4_proc_destroy_session, reinitialize the session, call
    nfs4_proc_create_session, clear the session reset state, and wake up the next
    task on the slot_tbl_waitq.
    
    Return the nfs4_proc_destroy_session status to the session reclaimer and
    check for NFS4ERR_BADSESSION and NFS4ERR_DEADSESSION. Other destroy session
    errors should be handled in nfs4_proc_destroy_session where the call can
    be retried with adjusted arguments.

    nfs41: add session setup to the state manager
    
    At mount, nfs_alloc_client sets the cl_state NFS4CLNT_LEASE_EXPIRED bit
    and nfs4_alloc_session sets the NFS4CLNT_SESSION_SETUP bit, so both bits are
    set when nfs4_lookup_root calls nfs4_recover_expired_lease which schedules
    the nfs4_state_manager and waits for it to complete.
    
    Place the session setup after the clientid establishment in nfs4_state_manager
    so that the session is setup right after the clientid has been established
    without rescheduling the state manager.
    
    Unlike nfsv4.0, the nfs_client struct is not ready to use until the session
    has been established.  Postpone marking the nfs_client struct to NFS_CS_READY
    until after a successful CREATE_SESSION call so that other threads cannot use
    the client until the session is established.
    
    If the EXCHANGE_ID call fails and the session has not been setup (the
    NFS4CLNT_SESSION_SETUP bit is set), mark the client with the error and return.
    
    If the session setup CREATE_SESSION call fails with NFS4ERR_STALE_CLIENTID
    which could occur due to server reboot or network partition inbetween the
    EXCHANGE_ID and CREATE_SESSION call, reset the NFS4CLNT_LEASE_EXPIRED and
    NFS4CLNT_SESSION_SETUP bits and try again.
    
    If the CREATE_SESSION call fails with other errors, mark the client with
    the error and return.

    [nfs41: NFS_CS_SESSION_SETUP cl_cons_state for back channel setup]
      On session setup, the CREATE_SESSION reply races with the server back channel
      probe which needs to succeed to setup the back channel. Set a new
      cl_cons_state NFS_CS_SESSION_SETUP just prior to the CREATE_SESSION call
      and add it as a valid state to nfs_find_client so that the client back channel
      can find the nfs_client struct and won't drop the server backchannel probe.
      Use a new cl_cons_state so that NFSv4.0 back channel behaviour which only
      sets NFS_CS_READY is unchanged.
      Adjust waiting on the nfs_client_active_wq accordingly.

    upcall is needed to resolve an uncached export referenced by a file handle.

    nfs41: exchange_id operation
    
    Implement the exchange_id operation conforming to
    http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-nfsv4-minorversion1-26
    
    Unlike NFSv4.0, NFSv4.1 requires machine credentials. RPC_AUTH_GSS machine
    credentials will be passed into the kernel at mount time to be available for
    the exchange_id operation.
    
    RPC_AUTH_UNIX root mounts can use the UNIX root credential. Store the root
    credential in the nfs_client struct.
    
    Without a credential, NFSv4.1 state renewal fails.

    Don't free the slot until after all rpc_restart_calls have completed.
    Session reset will require more work.
    
    As noted by Trond, since we're using rpc_wake_up_next rather than
    rpc_wake_up() we must always wake up the next task in the queue
    either by going through nfs4_free_slot, or just calling
    rpc_wake_up_next if no slot is to be freed.

    nfs41: free slot
    
    Free a slot in the slot table.
    
    Mark the slot as free in the bitmap-based allocation table
    by clearing a bit corresponding to the slotid.
    
    Update lowest_free_slotid if freed slotid is lower than that.
    Update highest_used_slotid.  In the case the freed slotid
    equals the highest_used_slotid, scan downwards for the next
    highest used slotid using the optimized fls* functions.
    
    Finally, wake up thread waiting on slot_tbl_waitq for a free slot
    to become available.

    Called at the rpc prepare stage.
    
    Add a status to nfs41_sequence_res, initialize it to one so that we catch
    rpc level failures which do not go through decode_sequence which sets
    the new status field.
    
    Note that upon an rpc level failure, we don't know if the server processed the
    sequence operation or not. Proceed as if the server did process the sequence
    operation.

    nfs41: find slot
    
    Find a free slot using bitmap-based allocation.
    Use the optimized ffz function to find a zero bit
    in the bitmap that indicates a free slot, starting
    the search from the 'lowest_free_slotid' position.
    
    If found, mark the slot as used in the bitmap, get
    the slot's slotid and seqid, and update max_slotid
    to be used by the SEQUENCE operation.
    
    Also, update lowest_free_slotid for next search.
    
    If no free slot was found the caller has to wait
    for a free slot (outside the scope of this function)

    nfs41: nfs4_setup_sequence
    
    Perform the nfs4_setup_sequence in the rpc_call_prepare state.
    
    If a session slot is not available, we will rpc_sleep_on the
    slot wait queue leaving the tk_action as rpc_call_prepare.
    
    Once we have a session slot, hang on to it even through rpc_restart_calls.
    Ensure the nfs41_sequence_res sr_slot pointer is NULL before rpc_run_task is
    called as nfs41_setup_sequence will only find a new slot if it is NULL.
    
    A future patch will call free slot after any rpc_restart_calls, and handle the
    rpc restart that result from a sequence operation error.

    nfs41: introduce nfs4_call_sync
    
    Use nfs4_call_sync rather than rpc_call_sync to provide
    for a nfs41 sessions-enabled interface for sessions manipulation.
    
    The nfs41 rpc logic uses the rpc_call_prepare method to
    recover and create the session, as well as selecting a free slot id
    and the rpc_call_done to free the slot and update slot table
    related metadata.
    
    In the coming patches we'll add rpc prepare and done routines
    for setting up the sequence op and processing the sequence result.
