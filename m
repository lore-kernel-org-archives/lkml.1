True, per cgroup dirty pages limit will help in making sure one cgroup
does not run away mojority share of the page cache. And once a cgroup 
hits dirty limit it is forced to do write back.

But my point is that it hels in bandwidth control but it does not directly
translate into what max bw patches are doing. I thought your goal with
max bw patches was to provide the consistent upper limit on BW seem by
the application. So till an application hits the per cgroup dirty limit,
it might see an spike in async write BW (much more than what has been 
specified by per cgroup max bw limit) and that will defeat the purpose
of max bw controller up to some extent?

I will correct myself here. After going through the documentation of
max bw controller patches, it looks like that you are also controlling
async writes only after they are actually being written to the disk and
not at the time of async write admission in page cache.

If that's the case then doing this control at IO scheduler level should
produce the similar results what you are seeing now with higher level 
control. In fact throttling at IO scheduler has advantage that one does
not have to worry about maintaining multiple queues for separate class
and prio requests as IO scheduler already does it.
