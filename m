  Yes, but there are far to few errno's to identify the problem. Imagine
how many different causes can result in EIO. Or have you ever tried to find
out why the crappy filesystem doesn't want to mount without looking into
kernel messages - the returned errno is always the same :). So I don't
think errno is a solution...
