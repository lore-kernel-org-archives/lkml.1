That actually is a fact. That's how MD RAID 5 is designed. And btw
those are originaly Ted's words.

I'm not sure what's rare about power failures. Unlike single sector
errors, my machine actually has a button that produces exactly that
event. Running degraded raid5 arrays for extended periods may be
slightly unusual configuration, but I suspect people should just do
that for testing. (And from the discussion, people seem to think that
degraded raid5 is equivalent to raid0).

substitute with "can (by design)"?

Now, if you can suggest useful version of that document meeting your
criteria?
