You are right. PagePrivate() is being set to 0 in drop_buffers(). 

The problem is do_launder_page() returns successfully if the page is not
dirty (our case), so ext3_launder_page() is not even get called. This
also explains why the log_wait_commit() approach doesn't work for me:(

Have to think other ways...could we pass some flag to
journal_try_to_free_buffers(), and ask journal_try_to_free_buffers()
wait for jbd commit to finish flushing the data, if the request is from
directo IO?
