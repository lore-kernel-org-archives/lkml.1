  Ok, I get it. Thanks for explanation. The problem with more writing
threads bites us also for ordinary SATA drives (the IO pattern and thus
throughput gets worse and worse the more threads do writes). The plan is to
let only flusher thread do the IO and throttled thread in
balance_dirty_pages just waits for flusher thread to do the work. There
were even patches for this floating around but I'm not sure what's happened
to them. So that part of the problem should be easy to solve.
  Another part is about sending commits - if we have just one thread doing
flushing, we have no problems with excessive commits for one inode. You're
right that we may want to avoid sending commits for background writeback
but until we send the commit, pages are just accumulating in the unstable
state, aren't they? So we might want to periodically send the commit for
the inode anyway to get rid of those pages. So from this point of view,
sending commit after each writepages call does not seem like a so bad idea
- although it might be more appropriate to send it some time after the
writepages call when we are not close to dirty limit so that server has
more time to do more natural "unforced" writeback...

  Yes, I agree that part is needed. But Fengguang already had patches in
that direction if my memory serves me well.

  So to recap: If we block tasks in balance_dirty_pages until unstable
pages are committed and make just one thread do the writing, what else is
missing to make you happy? :)
