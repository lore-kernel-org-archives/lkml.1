If the bridge is on the drive's board or in an enclosure, the user's
expectations are fully met.

If the bridge is on the motherboard, then the user may be surprised
unless he knows the motherboard well enough.

But this is _far_ less of an issue than
  - the hda<->sda confusion,
  - the confusion caused by all kernel default names put into a single
    namespace.

I don't have a personal interest in PATA/SATA distinction though.  I
suppose once PATA went into the SCSI namespace and then this namespace
is divided again, it's not a big issue anymore whether PATA and SATA
share an ATA namespace or are distinct, except perhaps for people with
IDE drive and eSATA slots.
