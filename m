substatute 'degraded MD RAID 5' for 'MD RAID 5' and you have a point here. 
although the language you are using is pretty harsh. you make it sound 
like this is a problem with ext3 when the filesystem has nothing to do 
with it. the problem is that a degraded raid 5 array can be corrupted by 
an additional failure.

by the way, while you are thinking about failures that can happen from a 
failed write corrupting additional blocks, think about the nightmare that 
can happen if those blocks are in the journal.

the 'repair' of ext2 by a fsck is actually much less than you are thinking 
that it is.
