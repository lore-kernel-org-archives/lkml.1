as I understood it, the proposal that I responded to was to change the 
kernel to detect if barriers are enabled for the entire stack or not, and 
if not disable the write caches on the drives.

there are definantly times when that is the correct thing to do, but I 
am not sure that it is the correct thing to do by default.
