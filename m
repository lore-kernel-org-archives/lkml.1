No I'd like to see those patches.  It would ideally allow LSM to become
*purely* restrictive and LPM to be purely empowering, presumably making
the resulting hook sets easier to review and maintain.  The LPM wouldn't
(I assume) gain any *new* hook points so we wouldn't be adding any new
places for hooks to be overriden by a rootkit.
