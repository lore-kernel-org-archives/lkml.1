My biggest concern is that you'll do something to fix a bug in the new
hardware and inadvertently create a bug for some old piece of hardware.

I'm not sure I see the downside to having a second driver.

One interesting possibility, if you feel you really must have a single driver that handles both sets of hardware is to do this:

------
a.c:

struct pci_driver a_pci_driver { ... };

b.c:

struct pci_driver b_pci_driver { ... };

common.c:

static int __init my_init(void)
{
	error = pci_register_driver(&a_pci_driver);
	if (error)
		return error;
	error = pci_register_driver(&b_pci_driver);
	if (error)
		pci_unregister_driver(&a_pci_driver);
	return error;
}

module_init(my_init);

------

Now you have two completely separated drivers which are bound together
into a single object file.  Bit wasteful, but might make your management
happier.
