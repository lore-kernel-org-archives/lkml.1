I guess it's caused by:
  [SCSI] add scsi_host and scsi_target to scsi_bus

  This patch implements scsi_host and scsi_target device types
  and adds both to the scsi_bus.
  http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=b0ed43360fdca227048d88a08290365cb681c1a8

and not by the re-parenting, so it should be limited to SCSI, right?

Thanks,
Kay
