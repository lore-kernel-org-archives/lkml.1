The general x86 implementation is used as the fall back for new AES-NI
based implementation. Because AES-NI can not be used in kernel soft_irq
context. If crypto layer is used to access general x86 implementation,
we will have tfm_ctx alignment issue, because AES-NI need tfm_ctx to be
16 byte aligned.

Oh, I should use struct crypto_aes_ctx instead of define struct aes_ctx.
The tfm_ctx definition is different. I will fix this. Except that, is
there any other issue?

Yes. I will use that. The only issue is that AES-NI need scheduled key
to be 16 bytes aligned, so we need move key_length in struct
crypto_aes_ctx to the end of the struct.

Now it is an Intel thing. But in the future it may become part of x86.
Intel named it as AES-NI (AES New Instructions), but name like
aes_ni_aes_set_key is not good too. Does aes_ni_set_key sound better?

Yes. AES-NI can benefit not only block modes. And the pipeline
implementation of AES-NI can benefit cbc(aes) decryption and ctr(aes)
even more (described in detail in white paper). We will work on that.

Yes. I will remove it.
