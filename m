Yes, very reasonable. It's now implemented in LTTng 0.77. Usage looks
like :

echo "*" > /mnt/debugfs/ltt/filter/ext4/dev
 (or just echo "" > /mnt/debugfs/ltt/filter/ext4/dev)
 (enables all devices, this is the default)
cat /mnt/debugfs/ltt/filter/ext4/dev
 (shows current filter)

echo sda1 > /mnt/debugfs/ltt/filter/ext4/dev
 (ext4 probes will only record information for device sda1)
echo 15 > /mnt/debugfs/ltt/filter/ext4/inode
 (in addition to device filtering, only inode 15 will be traced)

I think it makes sense to let people edit
ltt/probes/ext4-trace.c to implement their own more complex filtering
suiting their need. It can be compiled as a kernel module.

Here is the ext4 filtering feature diff :
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=linux-2.6-lttng.git;a=blob;f=ltt/probes/ext4-trace.c;h=4824a82fe9c2056d8dea83c57473ecf6c7f1c25d;hb=ad03cc9ead62d85d7641dcd19ea883f07bb7900a

Yes, LTTng consists of a "probe layer" which converts the data taken
from tracepoints into markers. For ext4 :
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=linux-2.6-lttng.git;a=blob;f=ltt/probes/ext4-trace.c;h=167357d87e730e33c3ca1fb335358ddc469473ad;hb=1861c6b862df1e6aad2d658984fbff137b15496e

By default, LTTng sends all the data, including the payload, identified
by the markers. Note that the marker format string is only recorded once
per trace in the metadata channel in a table, which makes everything
very compact and efficient.

LTTng has been heavily optimized to provide good performances. It uses
lightweight locking (RCU and per-cpu local atomic operations) and
splices the data directly from the memory buffers to disk without
intermediate copy.

A small test to give you an idea of the amount of data generated :

Copying 125MB worth of data (the drivers/ subdirectory) from an ext3 to
an ext4 partition, both on the same disk (raid1) + issuing sync, while
tracing with the trace output on the same disk (on the ext3 partition).

Copy duration : 12.99s
sync duration :  3.59s

Trace generated : 39M

ext4-related data:
516K  /tmp/trace/ext4_0
516K  /tmp/trace/ext4_1
516K  /tmp/trace/ext4_2
3.1M  /tmp/trace/ext4_3
516K  /tmp/trace/ext4_4
516K  /tmp/trace/ext4_5
516K  /tmp/trace/ext4_6
516K  /tmp/trace/ext4_7

Therefore, most of the trace size is padding due to unused buffer space.
I should say that this amount of ext4 data output (187.0kB/s) is really
not a problem neither for LTTng nor the disk.

A small speed test to figure out the tracer impact :
echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches; time (cp -ax drivers /mnt/testext4/; sync)

Without tracing (1):
real  0m18.182s to 0m19.026s

While tracing the overall kernel (including ext4) to disk :
real  0m19.309s to 0m19.986s (~4.8% execution time overhead over (1))

If you cannot afford to dirturb disk activity, you can use the flight
recorder mode, which only keep the data in memory buffers and overwrites
the oldest data until you stop tracing. At that point, you can grab the
buffers and dump them to disk to analyse the last events. It's very
useful if you know what particular condition you are looking for and if
you are only interested in the latest prior to the condition.

Flight recorder trace example :

lttctl -C -w /tmp/trace3 -o channel.all.overwrite=1 trace3
...
lttctl -D -w /tmp/trace3 trace3

While tracing the overall kernel (including ext4) to memory buffers :
real  0m18.748s to 0m19.388s (~2.2% execution time overhead over (1))

Note that the current ext4 probe implementation uses the format-string
serializer (printk-like code which iterates on the format string). For
very high throughput events, we can trivially change to
ltt-type-serializer.[ch] and diminish the execution time impact a lot.
It's just a bit more probe code to write. See kernel-trace.c to see
examples using such mechanism. The only reason why I use this dynamic
serializer is because I am lazy. ;)

Yes, we're working on having a binary-to-ascii converter in the kernel.
People at Fujitsu are helping on this, and I'm waiting for news in this
regard. That's the main element I'm waiting for before I start
submitting LTTng for mainline inclusion.

The current LTTng work flow does not require "huge" userspace utilities.
lttctl (from the ltt-control package) is just a helper over the
/mnt/debugfs/ltt/ interface; this can be done using simple "echo"
commands too. It's therefore optional.

lttd is the daemon which splices the data to disk. It is required.

lttv is built as a single executable with multiple libraries. The
package itself depends on GTK/GDK, but the textDump module really only
needs the glib library.

However, I agree that also providing a text output directly from a
debugfs file would be useful for low-overhead tracing. Note, however,
that this would increase the tracer footprint.
