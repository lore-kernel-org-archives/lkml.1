The existing users are iSCSI, SCTP, Infiniband, all of which are
clearly crucial in the embedded space :)

Well then you're going to have to do the check on every call.

Seriously, I'm happy to trim off any fat from the crypto API for the
embedded space.  For a start, if you only needed hashing then we
could do without the legacy cipher/compress support.  That shaves
off 800 bytes on i386.  There is also still some legacy code in
api.c itself.  Getting rid of them should get us to around 2K.

On the other hand, one of the advantages of doing it through the
crypto API is that this kind of selection is useful for quite a
few operations, e.g., xor or even memcpy.

Cheers,
