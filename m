Not really.. we don't really "mark devices as supporting MSI" right now, 
we generally mark them as not supporting it in certain cases and by 
default assume they do. So if a quirk doesn't hit on a particular 
chipset, then we go ahead and enable it. If there's some reason it 
doesn't work or we don't do something that's needed to make it work, and 
the driver requests it, we'll use it and it just won't work properly. So 
it's not really any more aggressive than what we have now..

It seems like we have kind of a random mix of MSI quirks related to MSI 
mappings:

Serverworks HT2000: check if PCIE bridge has MSI mapping enabled, if not 
disable MSI on PCIE bridge subordinate bus

NVIDIA CK804: check if HT MSI mapping enabled either on root bridge or 
on the PCIE bridge device, if not, disable MSI on PCIE bridge 
subordinate bus

Serverworks HT1000 (and proposed AMD 8132): just switch on HT MSI 
mapping on bridge device

All NVIDIA and ALi (which does appear to overlap with the CK804 one): If 
bus 0 device 0 function 0 is an HT slave, enable its MSI mapping, 
otherwise disable it

It seems like these could be combined into something like:

-For all buses, check if any device on the bus is an HT slave, if so, 
enable its HT MSI mapping. If not, disable it. (Should we also disable 
MSI on the bus if we disable it or there's no mapping capability? I 
would guess we likely should..)

-For all PCI bridges other than device 0 function 0 that have HT MSI 
Mapping capability, check if our bus (or an upstream one?) has a device 
marked as an HT slave with enabled MSI mapping. If so, then enable the 
capability, if not then disable it and disable MSI on subordinate bus.

Essentially it should make sure that the mappings are enabled all the 
way up the chain, and if they can't be then we disable MSI. This could 
be totally wrong though, I don't know HT that well, hopefully someone 
else does :-)

There's the issue that Eric pointed out about the MSI mapping address 
possibly not being set up on some platforms. However, right now we'll 
just blindly try and use MSI on such setups anyway, so I don't see it's 
really worsening the situation.

We would also still need the 8131 quirk, since presumably it doesn't 
have HT MSI Mapping capability so we wouldn't know to disable MSI on it 
from the above.
