All i'd like to ask is WHY!?
WHY such a big open heart surgery?
OK, you have your reasons.

The machine is still production. It will be replaced by a 64bit system=20
with an AACRAID card some time in the future. Then, i could maybe test=20
patches on the old machine. But unfortunatly, it's not my machine. It's=20
just administrated by me. And i don't know, what's exactly is the future =

of it.

I see. Thanks for the hint. Would be an alternative. Actually, i don't=20
need 2.6.24 - but if something security related is fixed, then i'm not=20
able to move on to 2.6.24. And i'm using Gentoo. There's not really a=20
kernel maintained by the distribution.

I don't think, it's a seperate card, that i could send you. It's some=20
19" rack server with such a card on-board, i think.


So it don't see much opportunity for me to test patched and stuff :-(
