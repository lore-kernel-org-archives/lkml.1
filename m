I'm just pointing out that the NFS client already calls
__set_page_dirty_nobuffers() while holding the page lock inside the
nfs_vm_page_mkwrite() call, so having the VM do it too in the call to
set_page_dirty_balance() is actually redundant. IOW: as far as the NFS
code is concerned, we can get rid of the ->set_page_dirty() callback in
that situation.

I couldn't find any other places in the VM code where we can have a
dirty pte without also having called page_mkwrite() (and hence
__set_page_dirty_nobuffers). As I said, adding a WARN_ON(!PageDirty())
in ->set_page_dirty() didn't ever trigger any cases where the
set_page_dirty() was actually setting the dirty bit (except in the case
where we race with page writeout in do_wp_page() and __do_fault()).

That's why I believe disabling ->set_page_dirty() is safe here, and will
in fact suffice to fix the page writeout race.

Cheers
