I think the hardware method is preferable, actually. Doing this in the
block layer would mean keeping track of idle time, and that quickly
turns into a lot of timer management. Not exactly free, in terms of CPU
usage.

I've yet to do some power measurements with this ahci patch, I just
noticed that with min_power performance drops from ~55mb/sec to
~15mb/sec sequential on my drive. That's pretty drastic :-)
