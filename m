Interesting you should mention the tso...  We recently went through and
turned on TSO on all of our systems, trying it out to see if it helped
with performance...  This could be something to do with that.  I can try
disabling the tso on all of the servers and see if that helps with the
memory.  Actually, I think I will, and I will monitor the situation.  I
think it might help some, but I still think there may be something else
going on in a deep corner...

Not for sure what tipc is either....

Yes, we are getting a continuous stream of the too many open connections
scrolling across our logs.

No problems.  I feel good if I exercised some deep corner of the code
and found something that needed flushed out, that's what the experience
is all about, isn't it?
