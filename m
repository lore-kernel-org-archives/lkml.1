Well, IMHO the big concern is at which level we want to implement the
logic of control: IO scheduler, when the IO requests are already
submitted and need to be dispatched, or at high level when the
applications generates IO requests (or maybe both).

And, as pointed by Andrew, do everything by a cgroup-based controller.

The other features, proportional BW, throttling, take the current ioprio
model in account, etc. are implementation details and any of the
proposed solutions can be extended to support all these features. I
mean, io-throttle can be extended to support proportional BW (for a
certain perspective it is already provided by the throttling water mark
in v16), as well as the IO scheduler based controller can be extended to
support absolute BW limits. The same for dm-ioband. I don't think
there're huge obstacle to merge the functionalities in this sense.

Yes, sorry for my late, I quickly tested your patchset, but I still need
to understand many details of your solution. In the next days I'll
re-read everything carefully and I'll try to do a detailed review of
your patchset (just re-building the kernel with your patchset applied).

mmmh... changing the logic at the elevator and all IO schedulers doesn't
sound like reduced complexity and less code changed. With io-throttle we
just need to place the cgroup_io_throttle() hook in the right functions
where we want to apply throttling. This is a quite easy approach to
extend the IO control also to logical devices (more in general devices
that use their own make_request_fn) or even network-attached devices, as
well as networking filesystems, etc.

But I may be wrong. As I said I still need to review in the details your
solution.

It is surely worth to be explored. Honestly, I don't know if it would be
a better solution or not. Probably comparing some results with different
IO workloads is the best way to proceed and decide which is the right
way to go. This is necessary IMHO, before totally dropping one solution
or another.

No, but as said above my patchset provides the interfaces to apply the
IO control and accounting wherever we want. At the moment there's just
one interface, cgroup_io_throttle().
