It should not cause an additional write. Can you let me why it would
result in additional write ?

That is true

block allocator should be improved to fix that. For example ext4
mballoc also look at the logical file block number when doing block
allocation. So if we does enough reservation it should handle the 
the first-accessed order and sequential order allocation properly.

Another reason why I think we would need ext3_page_mkwrite is, if we
really are out of space how do we handle it ? Currently the patch you
posted does redirty_page_for_writepage, which would imply we can't
reclaim the page and since get_block get ENOSPC we can't allocate
blocks.
