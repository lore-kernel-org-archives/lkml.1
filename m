Well, my current patch is a hack.  If I had come up with a proven theory
(hopefully Mel can prove it ;), it definitely would have gone through
the dm-devel lists.

The problem is that async threads still imply a kind of ordering.
If there's a fifo serviced by one thread or 10, the latency ramifications
are very similar for a new entry on the list.  We have to wait for a
large portion of the low-prio items in order to service a high prio
item.

With a queue dedicated to sync requests and one dedicated to async,
you'll get better read latencies.  Btrfs has a similar problem around
the crc helper threads and it ends up solving things with two different
lists (high and low prio) processed by one thread.
