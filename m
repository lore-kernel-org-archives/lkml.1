I agree with Andrew.  The historical policy of ext2/3/4 is that write
errors for FILE DATA propagate to the application via EIO, regardless
of whether ordered mode is active or not.  If filesystem METADATA is
involved, yes this should cause an ext3_error() to be called and the
policy for what to do next is controlled by the administrator.

If the journal is aborted for a file data write error, the node maybe
panics (errors=panic) or is rebooted by the administrator, then e2fsck
is run and no problem is found (which it will not because e2fsck does
not check file data), then all that has been accomplished is to reboot
the node.

Applications should check the error return codes from their writes,
and call fsync on the file before closing it if they are really worried
about whether the data made it to disk safely, otherwise even a read-only
filesystem will not cause the application to notice anything.

Now, if we have a problem where the write error from the journal checkpoint
is not being propagated back to the original buffer, that is a different
issue.  For ordered-mode data I don't _think_ that the data buffers are
mirrored when a transaction is closed, so as long as the !buffer_uptodate()
error is propagated back to the caller on fsync() that is enough.

We might also consider having a separate mechanism to handle write failures,
but I don't think that that should be intermixed with the ext3 error handling
for metadata errors.

Cheers, Andreas
