The amount of code is not the point. The way to impact on the
lib/swiotlb.c is totally wrong from the perspective of the kernel
design; it uses architecture code in the very original (xen) way.

I don't think so. We always have the reasonable amount of duplication
rather than integration in a dirty way (at least about IOMMU
code).

Ian didn't give a pointer to his code in a public place so I'm not
sure his claim is valid. But if his code does the right thing and
the duplication is less than 400 lines, it doesn't sound that bad to
me.
