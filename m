The point of all of this is that if you enable async scanning, you need
a method of waiting for the scans to complete, which is all this module
does (you insert it and it doesn't come back from the insertion until
all the pending async scans are complete).  It's tristate because really
it only makes sense to be M or N.  The consensus is that, given async
scanning is always an option, this function should always be built as a
module *if* modules and SCSI are enabled ... because you might have a
HBA module you enabled async scanning for and you need to wait.

There's really not much point giving the user the choice, since this
module is part of the initrd sequence ... it's not really anything a
user would want to use stand alone, hence there's no point giving a
choice about it.
