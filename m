I think this should be good. I had added this "extract" in the past, because
preemption logic could do lookup which an entity was active.

Actually we need a more proper definition of in-class preemption. Across
class preemption means that RT class always gets to run first.

What does in-class preemption mean? If I look at the current CFQ code,
it does look like that preempting process will gain share. It is always
added to the front of the tree with "rb_key=0" and that means, this new
queue will get fresh time slice (even if it got time slice very recently).

Currently I have just tried to make the behavior same as CFQ to reduce
the possiblility of regressions. That's a different thing that we can
discuss what should be the exact behavior in case of in-class preemption
and first it needs to be fixed in CFQ, if current behavior is an issue.

On the other hand, I am not sure if previous bfq preemption logic was
working. We were checking if the new request belonged to the queue which
will be served next, then preempt the existing queue. While looking
for the next queue, I think we did not consider the current active
entity (as it was not on the tree). So after expiry of the current
queue, it might get selected next if it has not got its share. So there
was no point in preempting the queue. If queue already got its share, then
anyway the next queue will be selected next and there is no point in
preempting the current queue.

I am not sure why reads should preempt writes in CFQ. We are already giving
preference to reads by giving these bigger time slice as compared to
writes and that should take care of read being preferred over writes?
