I frankly think NBD is at a pretty comfortable level. It's internally
very simple (and hardware-agnostic). And moderately easy to do in
silicon.

But I'm not going to defend iSCSI. I worked on the first implementation
(what became the Cisco iSCSI driver) and I have no love for iSCSI at
all. It should have been (and started out as) a nearly trivial
encapsulation of SCSI over TCP much like ATA over Ethernet but quickly
lost the plot when committees got ahold of it.
