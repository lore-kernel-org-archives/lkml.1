Firstly, I had omitted that I'd booted the kernel with
debug_objects=1, which provides the canary here.

The primary failure I see is 'mount.nfs4: internal error', and always
after 358 umount/mount cycles (plus 1 initial mount) which gives us a
clue; 'netstat' shows all these connections in a TIME_WAIT state, thus
the bug relates to the inability to allocate a socket error path. I
found that after the connection lifetime expired, you can mount again,
which corroborates this theory.

In this case, we saw the mount() syscall result in the mount.nfsv4
process being SEGV'd when booted with 'debug_object=1', without this
option, we see:

# strace /sbin/mount.nfs4 x1:/ /store
...
mount("x1:/", "/store", "nfs4", 0,
"addr=192.168.0.250,clientaddr=19"...) = -1 EIO (Input/output error)

So, it's impossible to tell when the corruption was introduced, as it
has only become detectable recently.

It's worth a look-over of the socket-allocation error path, if someone
can check, and reproduces 100% with the 'debug_object=1' param,
available since 2.6.26-rc1 and 359 mounts in quick succession.

Thanks!
