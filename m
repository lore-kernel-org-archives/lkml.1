journal_try_to_free_buffers() could race with jbd commit transaction when
the later is holding the buffer reference while waiting for the data buffer
to flush to disk. If the caller of journal_try_to_free_buffers() request
tries hard to release the buffers, it will treat the failure as error and return
back to the caller. We have seen the directo IO failed due to this race. 
Some of the caller of releasepage() also expecting the buffer to be dropped
when passed with GFP_KERNEL mask to the releasepage()->journal_try_to_free_buffers().

With this patch, if the caller is passing the __GFP_WAIT and __GFP_FS 
to indicating this call could wait, in case of try_to_free_buffers() failed,
let's waiting for journal_commit_transaction() to finish commit the 
current committing transaction, then try to free those buffers again.
