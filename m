Confirmed. It then hangs while checking/loading the initramfs.

I've tried this patch with 2.6.28.8 and it fixes the hang! Maybe that
aspect should be mentioned in the commit log?

I've also tested the patch with 2.6.29-rc8 and it also fixes the hang
during login I reported with that [1]. Which means that not only jiffies is
affected, but also tod! And that does not really surprise me because after
the system switches to tod, I also see a continuously increasing error
with clock->xtime_nsec always equal to -4096 (see below).

Am I correct that any kernel starting from 2.6.19 is affected by this, and
that it's the most likely cause of Debian bug report
http://bugs.debian.org/511334? If so, I'll get it pushed into Debian's
stable kernels.

Cheers,
FJP
