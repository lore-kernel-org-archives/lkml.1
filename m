For failed commands we don't have that information.  All we know is how
many bytes were actually transferred (because the HBA keeps a count), so
it's the actual transfer count we use to construct the residual.  No
imputation of validity or otherwise.  It just says I transferred this
amount, based on the error make of it what you will.

Well, there are certain SCSI conditions called deferred errors and the
like where we return Check Condition but everything's OK, redisual count
should be zero, same goes for recovered errors ... there are actually
lots of things we can get back as an "error" which means I'm warning you
of something, but the transfer was OK.  Likewise we get unit attentions
(essentialy AENs) which mean I'm telling you something before you start,
so please try again.  Here residual would be the full transfer.   Also,
we have the nasty USB case where no error return but an actual residual
tells you something really went wrong.

OK, that's what we'll do then, thanks.
