Right.   gcc simply doesn't have any way to know how heavyweight an
asm() statement is, and it WILL do the wrong thing in many cases --
especially the ones which involve an out-of-line recovery stub.  This is
due to a fundamental design decision in gcc to not integrate the
compiler and assembler (which some compilers do.)

The good part here is that the assembly ones really don't have much
subtlety -- a function call is at least five bytes, usually more once
you count in the register spill penalties -- so __always_inline-ing them
should still end up with numbers looking very much like the above.

The main reason to do #2 over #3 would be for programmer documentation.
 There simply should be no reason to ever out-of-lining these.  However,
documenting the reason to the programmer is a valuable thing in itself.
