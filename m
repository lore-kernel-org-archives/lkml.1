Not sure if I know enough git to pull your trees, or if this cobbler's child will 
have much in the way of bigger systems, but there is a chance I might - contact 
me offline with some pointers on how to pull and build the bits and such.

Mega *bits* per second?  And those were 4K sends right?  That seems rather low 
for loopback - I would have expected nearly two orders of magnitude more.  I 
wonder if the intra-stack flow control kicked-in?  You might try adding test 
specific -S and -s options to set much larger socket buffers to try to avoid 
that.  Or simply use TCP.

netperf -H <foo> ... -- -s 1M -S 1M -m 4K

If bandwidth is an issue, that is to say one saturates the link before much of 
anything "interesting" happens in the host you can use something like aggregate 
TCP_RR - ./configure with --enable_burst and then something like

netperf -H <remote> -t TCP_RR -- -D -b 32

and it will have as many as 33 discrete transactions in flight at one time on the 
one connection.  The -D is there to set TCP_NODELAY to preclude TCP chunking the 
single-byte (default, take your pick of a more reasonable size) transactions into 
one segment.

Hope... but verify :)

Yes, by (ab)using the confidence intervals code.  Poke around in 
http://www.netperf.org/svn/netperf2/doc/netperf.html in the "Aggregates" section, 
and I can go into further details offline (or here if folks want to see the 
discussion).
