The latter option is more or less what the patch at the start of this
thread did, although via a param to tcrypt, not keying off the fips
flag. If I were to modify the patch to drop the mod param usage, and
instead key off the fips flag to not exit, would that be acceptable
for committing until such time as the userspace interface is ready?
