The problem with debugfs is that it claims to not be an ABI but it is
lying. Distributions ship tools that depend on portions of debugfs. And
they also ship debugfs in their kernel. So it is effectively the same
as /proc, except with the 1.0-era everything-goes attitude rather than
the 2.6-era we-should-really-think-about-this one.

Pushing stuff from procfs to debugfs is thus just setting us up for pain
down the road. Don't do it. In five years, we'll discover we can't turn
debugfs off or even clean it up because too much relies on it.

If you think that debugfs is NOT an ABI, then I'm sure you'll be happy
to ack my patch entitled 'gratuitously break usbmon to remind folks that
debugfs is not an ABI'.
