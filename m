I did quick "sum of symbol sizes" lookup of the   raid.ko, and got
it like this:

nm -t d -n -S /lib/modules/2.6.27.21-170.2.56.fc10.x86_64/kernel/drivers/md/raid456.ko | grep raid4|awk '{print $2}'|sed -e 's/^0*//g'|awk '{sum+=$1}END{print sum}'
  ...

raid4:   152
raid5:  7165
raid6: 75558

Entire 64kB of that raid6 is single pre-initialized r/o datablock:  raid6_gfmul

So yes, having RAID6 personality as separate module would be appropriate for
systems that are only interested in RAID4 or RAID5.  Separating the RAID4
personality wastes space, separating RAID5 ...  barely 2 of 4k memory pages.

There are perhaps a few kB more of codes for RAID5 and RAID6 classes - not all
local functions at each are named with relevant prefix,  but overall I would
consider extracting RAID6 as a reasonable goal with common codes on RAID4/5.

Also, systems with so many disks that they run RAID4/5/6 to begin with are
likely to have enough memory so that "wasted" 75-80 kB does not matter.
