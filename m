Well, it's open source ... this interface has had a better passage than
some of the block ones I could name.

I think the current hack is the simplest way to fix up 2.6.25, given the
lateness in the -rc cycle ... we can do a far better job in 2.6.26 and
still be backwards compatible with the 2.6.25 hack.  In fact, I
committed to Kay that we would ... although if you want to do it
instead, that would be easier for me.

Thanks,

James
