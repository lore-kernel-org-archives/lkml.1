Interesting. I switched from cfq to deadline some time ago, due to abysmal 
XFS performance on parallel IO - aptitude upgrade and doing desktop 
stuff. Just my subjective perception, but I have seen it crawl, even 
stall for 5-10 seconds easily at times. I found deadline to be way faster 
initially, but then it rarely happened that IO for desktop tasks is 
basically stalled for even longer, say 15 seconds or more, on parallel 
IO. However I can't remember having this problem with the last kernel 
2.6.26.2.

I am now testing with cfq again. On a ThinkPad T42 internal 160 GB 
harddisk with barriers enabled. But you tell, it only happens on certain 
servers, so I might have seen something different.

Thus I had the rough feeling that something is wrong with at least CFQ and 
XFS together, but I couldn't prove it back then. I have no idea how to 
easily do a reproducable test case. Maybe having a script that unpacks 
kernel source archives while I try to use the desktop...
