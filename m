Hi, I was playing with patches from

http://www.linux-nfs.org/Linux-2.6.x/2.6.27/

and find, that 

.../fixups_4/linux-2.6.27-001-respond_promptly_to_socket_errors.dif
.../fixups_4/linux-2.6.27-002-respond_promptly_to_socket_errors_2.dif

change the locking behaviour from long to endless lock to 1-2sec locks and
it seems there are fewer situations when it locks.

The packet storms does not repeat once I switched to 2.6.27.24 (and .25)
kernels so far, so it may be solved by some other patch inside .24 too.

Together with tcp_linger patch it seems to improve the situation a lot to
state when it is possible for me to use 2.6.27.x kernels.

Trond, will it be possible to get tcp_linger and the upper twho patches to
2.6.27.x stable queue so others get these fixes?

Big thanks for your help to all.
