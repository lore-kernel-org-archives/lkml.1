+ * Parameter:
+ *   @1: return code
+ * Description:
+ * The z/VM *MONITOR record device driver failed to read monitor data
+ * because the IUCV REPLY function failed. The read function against
+ * the monitor record device returns EIO. All monitor data that has been read
+ * since the last read with 0 size is incorrect.
+ * User action:
+ * Disregard all monitor data that has been read since the last read with
+ * 0 size. If the device driver has been compiled as a separate module, unload
+ * and reload the monreader module. If the device driver has been compiled
+ * into the kernel, reboot Linux. For more information about possible causes
+ * of the error see the IUCV section in "z/VM CP Programming Services" and

+ * Tag: monreader.3
+ * Text: "The read queue for monitor data is full"
+ * Severity: Warning
+ * Description:
+ * The read function of the z/VM *MONITOR device driver returns EOVERFLOW
+ * because not enough monitor data has been read since the monitor device
+ * has been opened. Monitor data already read are valid and subsequent reads
+ * return valid data but some intermediate data might be missing.
+ * User action:
+ * Be aware that monitor data might be missing. Assure that you regularly

+ * The z/VM *MONITOR record device driver receives monitor records through
+ * an IUCV connection to the z/VM *MONITOR system service. This connection
+ * could not be established when the monitor record device was opened. If
+ * the return code is 15, your z/VM guest virtual machine is not authorized

+ * User action:
+ * If the return code is 15, ensure that the IUCV *MONITOR statement is

+ * Tag: monreader.6
+ * Text: "The z/VM *MONITOR record device driver cannot be loaded without z/VM"
+ * Severity: Error
+ * Description:
+ * The z/VM *MONITOR record device driver uses z/VM system services to provide
+ * monitor data about z/VM guest operating systems to applications on Linux.
+ * On Linux instances that run in environments other than the z/VM hypervisor,
+ * the z/VM *MONITOR record device driver does not provide any useful
+ * function and the corresponding monreader module cannot be loaded.
+ * User action:
+ * Load the z/VM *MONITOR record device driver only on Linux instances that run
+ * as guest operating systems of the z/VM hypervisor. If the z/VM *MONITOR
+ * record device driver has been compiled into the kernel, ignore this message.

+ * Tag: monreader.7
+ * Text: "The z/VM *MONITOR record device driver failed to register with IUCV"
+ * Severity: Error
+ * Description:
+ * The z/VM *MONITOR record device driver receives monitor data through an IUCV
+ * connection and needs to register with the IUCV device driver. This
+ * registration failed and the z/VM *MONITOR record device driver was not
+ * loaded. A possible cause of this problem is insufficient memory.
+ * User action:
+ * Free some memory and try again to load the module. If the z/VM *MONITOR
+ * record device driver has been compiled into the kernel, you might have to
+ * configure more memory and reboot Linux. If you do not want to read monitor
+ * data, ignore this message.

+ * Description:
+ * The DCSS that was specified with the monreader.mondcss kernel parameter or
+ * with the mondcss module parameter cannot be a *MONITOR DCSS because it is
+ * not of type SC.
+ * User action:
+ * Confirm that you are using the name of the DCSS that has been configured as
