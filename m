Sorry I should have put that in the original post, I added debugging to
kobject_add to check to see if we were adding something twice, thats how I
figured out who was doing it

kobject rport-3:0-0: registering. parent: host3, set: devices

kobject rport-3:0-2: registering. parent: host3, set: devices

kobject rport-3:0-3: registering. parent: host3, set: devices

kobject rport-3:0-4: registering. parent: host3, set: devices

kobject_add failed for 3:0:0:0 with -EEXIST, don't try to register things with 
the same name in the same directory.

Async in the first case is set and in the second case it isn't set.  Thank you,
