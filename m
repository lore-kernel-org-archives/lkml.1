Ext3 needs to submit a large number of blocks for writing with
WRITE_SYNC priority, without unplugging the queue, until they are all
submitted.  Then we want to let things rip.  (Hence the "add an
explicit unplug where it is needed".)

It may be that it's easier from an less-lines-of-the-kernels-to-change
point of view to add a WRITE_SYNC_PLUGGED which doesn't do the unplug,
and keep WRITE_SNYC as having the implicit unplug.  Or maybe it would
be better to completely separate the "send a write which is marked as
SYNC" from the "implicit unplug" in the API.

Jens, do you have an opinion/preference?
