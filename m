Hi Joe,

Yes, these are the head nodes and not the NFS servers.

Right now, (system load 40, but still quite responsive box):

The mount options are pretty standard NFSv3 via tcp, ...:

s02:/atlashome/USER on /home/USER type nfs (rw,vers=3,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,namlen=255,soft,nointr,nolock,noacl,proto=tcp,
timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,mountaddr=10.20.20.2,mountvers=3,mountproto=tcp,addr=10.20.20.2)

The linux data server are exporting NFS with async, the X4500 should be about the same,
i.e. we set nocacheflushing for the zpool

Well, that proofs that I should never be let near any serious programming - 
at least not in time critical parts of the codes ;)

That was my idea as well.

I'll try that and will dive again into iotop as well.
