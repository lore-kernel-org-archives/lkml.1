ACK.  I'll take care of getting this into the patch queue.  I'll
include both the ext3 and ext4 variants, since this one is simple
enough that it's highly unlikely to conflict with anything Andrew
might have in the -mm tree.  This is also much more of a cleanup than
anything else, so I don't think we need to push it until the merge
window.  (I *think* it might be possible for a 2k filesystems and
*very* long filenames we might possibly be able to trigger a
failure but it would be very hard to do, and it's been around for a
very long time without anyone complaining about an actual real-life
problem getting trigger.)
