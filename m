Since the machine seems to be otherwise alive, can you do a sysrq-W (which 
is most easily done by just doing a

	echo w > /proc/sysrq-trigger

and you don't actually need any console access or anything like that).

That should give you all the blocked process traces, and if it's a 
deadlock on some semaphore or other, it should all stand out quite nicely.

In fact, things like the above are probably worth scripting for any 
automated testing - if you auto-fail after some time, please make the 
failure case do that sysrq-W by default.

(The other sysrq things can be useful too - "T" shows the same as "W", 
except for _all_ tasks, which is often so verbose that it hides the 
problem, but is sometimes the right thing to do).
