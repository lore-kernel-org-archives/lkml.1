We have 1536 MB of ram. It is possible that at the time of the crash we
were near enomem conditions, I don;t know for sure but we have seen such
spikes on our servers.

By new we meant 48 hours old.

We did some basic testing. But as a filesystem developer, how would you
test a filesystem so that you would be comfortable with the stability of 
the filesystem and be worry free in terms of faulty hardware?

one unit, 8HDDs, a stripe of 4 mirrors.

we will run repair tonight.

Yes, we have ECC memory.
We will try to run memtest86 as soon as possible.
There were no I/O errors in the log prior to the shutdown message.

Btw, this is a vmware image. /vol/6 is an exported physical partition.
