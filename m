Ummm - why can't you unfreeze the root fs from userspace? freezing
only prevents modification to the filesystem. A frozen filesystem is
effectively a read-only filesystem...

On XFS:

# xfs_freeze -f /
# echo $?
0
# xfs_freeze -u /
# echo $?
0

The underlying filesystem is broken w.r.t. freezing if you can't
read from it successfully once it's been frozen....

What application developer will ever use this?

Right - the application is broken and needs fixing.  We don't need
to supply a crutch in a "new" API to support hypothetically broken
applications that don't actually exist yet.
