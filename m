The RT scheduler is a bit more aggressive than it use to be. It use to
just migrate RT tasks when the migration thread woke up, and did that in
"bulk".  Now, when an individual RT task wakes up and it can not run on
the current CPU but can on another CPU, it is scheduled immediately, and
an IPI is sent out.

As for context switching, it would be the same amount as before, but the
difference is that the RT task will try to wake up as soon as possible.
This also causes RT tasks to bounce around CPUs more often.

If there are many threads, they should not be RT, unless there is some
design behind it.

Forgive me if you already did this and said so, but what is the result
of just making the writer an RT task and keeping all the readers as
SCHED_OTHER?
