That's a bug, and has nothing to do with power consumption. ;)

I can see that there is a dirty item in the filesystem:

Entering kdb (current=0xe00000b8f4fe0000, pid 30046) on processor 3 due to Breakpoint @ 0xa000000100454fc0

the superblock is dirty, and the lsn is well beyond the target
of the xfsaild hence it *should* be idling. However, it isn't
idling because there is a dirty item in the list and the idle trigger
of "is list empty" is not tripping.

I only managed to reproduce this on a lazy superblock counter
filesystem (i.e.  new mkfs and recent kernel), as it logs the
superblock every so often, and that is probably what is keeping the
fs dirty like this.

Can you see if the patch below fixes the problem.

---

Idle state is not being detected properly by the xfsaild push
code. The current idle state is detected by an empty list
which may never happen with mostly idle filesystem or one
using lazy superblock counters. A single dirty item in the
list will result repeated looping to push everything past
the target when everything because it fails to check if we
managed to push anything.

Fix by considering a dirty list with everything past the target
as an idle state and set the timeout appropriately.
