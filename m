I think it is still working for slow devices, our testing will try and 
verify that.

Slower devices were still great with this code, but that can vary with 
high HZ kernels. Could you have tested and seen poor results with a 
1000HZ kernel (where the slow devices don't sleep long enough?)

We should do a clean retest and repost with the types of storage we have 
at hand. Roughly, that would include:

    * RAM disk
    * mid sized array (FC first,  iSCSI second?)
    * S-ATA
    * SAS

It would also be interesting to test with various HZ settings (100, 250, 
1000).

Would that fill in most of the interesting spots?

Not sure how much time we have to cover all of these, but we will take a 
stab at it ;-)
