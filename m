Thanks Harald and Linus,

The bug has been in the advansys driver. 2.6.23 and 2.6.24 works just
because the size of Scsi_Host structure was multiples of 8. After
2.6.24, some patches change Scsi_Host structure and now the size is
not multiples of 8. So we hit this bug.


I'll resend the patch with a proper description.
