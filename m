(subject line updated)

After further analysis, I see that NFS services do correctly recover
after the link excursion, however we see:
 - link is restored
 - the manager kthread gets created, does some work
 - we see lock reclamation fail [1]
 - after a short while, NFS read()s continue, all is good
 - the manager kthread spins indefinitely [2, 3] on (struct
rpc_wait_queue)queue->lock with spin_lock_bh() [see rpc_wake_up]

This seems reproducible with various kernel debugging enabled (perhaps
suggesting use-after-free via the lock being reinitialised/poisoned?).

Let me know if anything else may help track this down (config, stack
frame resolution etc). I'll take a deeper look if I get time in a
couple of weeks, but alas it may be after 2.6.31 is released. NFS+RPC
debugging (taken at a different time than [1]) at
http://quora.org/hive/nfs-manager-spin.bz2 .

Thanks,
  Daniel
