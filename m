I don't know what to do about this, sorry.  That driver is basically
unmaintained.

Looking through the boot messages, this:

> sas: DONE DISCOVERY on port 1, pid:1712, result:0
> sas: sas_form_port: phy0 belongs to port0 already(1)!
> sas: sas_form_port: phy1 belongs to port1 already(1)!

is the only thing which stands out to me.  And according to google,
you're basically the only person who ever saw it come out.

ooh, that code has a maintainer.  Darrick, does the above look like
something which could make the driver run all slowly?

Thanks.
