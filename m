That's going to make hch unhappy.

This was (correctly) declared to be static.  We should define it that way
too (I didn't know you could do this, actually).

That's an O(n^2) search.  If it is at all possible to hit a catastrophic
slowdown in here, you can bet that someone out there will indeed hit it in
real life.

I'm too lazy to look, but we might need to check things like I_FREEING
and I_CLEAR before taking a ref on this inode.
