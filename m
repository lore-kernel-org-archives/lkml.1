This is getting silly. Let me repeat it, because IMO it's really 
straightforward. My (quick) investigation based on the function name 
that was in the error message:

  drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_init.c:1897: error: implicit declaration
  of function 'pci_enable_device_bars'

a straightforward search on "pci_enable_device_bars" led to a recent PCI 
API related change pushed by Greg, with the following straightforward 
subject line:

  [GIT PATCH] PCI patches for 2.6.24

  http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/1/483

the email had this description:

 |  Some general cleanups, minor tweaks, and a bit of PCI hotplug 
 |  updates, and some PCI Express updates for new features, if your 
 |  hardware happens to support it.

furthermore, the mail already had two PCI mailing lists in its Cc: line. 
The PCI subsystem regularly does cross-treee changes, by its nature.

i had all reasons to believe that this was a (innocious looking) PCI 
subsystem change and a harmless (but a tad under-tested) API cleanup 
that went haywire: it smelled like PCI, it walked like PCI and it 
quacked like PCI.

So to me it was clearly a PCI merge not an SCSI merge, and i was really 
only interested in the first hop, i.e. i was primarily interested in the 
pull request that clearly changed multiple subsystems, and a seemingly 
API change that broke the build.

Three mailing lists and three maintainers were already on the Cc: line 
for that pull request. So tell me, exactly what should have let me to 
believe that i should have added anyone else to the _already_ sizable 
Cc: line?? I could have done it, had i have more time and had i realized 
the full scope of the change and the somewhat misleading Cc:s that were 
on the original pull request, but i clearly was not _required_ to - and 
your suggestions to the contrary are ridiculous.

Furthermore i reject the sometimes derogatory undertone of your mails 
that implies that i should somehow have done more or different work than 
i already did.

I really hope you treat other contributors and bug-reporters better than 
you treated me :( Shall this be my last voluntary SCSI contribution for 
a good while.

	Ingo
