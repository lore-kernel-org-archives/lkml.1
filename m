The sg driver's async interface has been pretty stable for
a long time. The sync SG_IO ioctl is built on top of the
async interface. That makes the async interface extremely
well tested.

The write()/read() async interface in sg does have one
problem: when a command is dispatched via a write()
it would be very useful to get back a tag but that
violates write()'s second argument: 'const void * buf'.
That tag could be useful both for identification of the
response and by task management functions.

I was hoping that the 'flags' field in sgv4 could be used
to implement the variants:
     SG_IO_SUBMIT - start a new blk_execute_rq_nowait()
     SG_IO_TEST   - complete and return a previous req
     SG_IO_WAIT   - wait for a req to finish, interruptibly

that way the existing SG_IO ioctl is sufficient.

And if Tomo doesn't want to do it in the bsg driver,
then it could be done it the sg driver.
