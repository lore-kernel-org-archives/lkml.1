Actually Ric is. He's trying hard to make RAID5 look better than it
really is.

I have not seen one that works :-(.

Do the flash manufacturers claim they do not cause collateral damage
during powerfail? If not, they probably are dangerous.

Anyway, you wanted a test, and one is attached. It normally takes like
4 unplugs to uncover problems.

Offer better docs? You are right that it does not lose whole stripe,
it merely loses random block on same stripe, but result for journaling
filesystem is similar.
