Well, I believe it should be changed. "You need to mount /sys, then
echo X to Y before kill -9 works" does not look nice... I agree it is
not easy.

Ok, I don't know much about FUSE. In current version, if user creates
infinite maze and mounts it under ~, updatedb just does not enter it?

Not bad indeed. But I'd consider 'kill -9 not working' to be DoS
vulnerability... and I'm woried about problems fuse + user mounts
expose in other parts of system.
