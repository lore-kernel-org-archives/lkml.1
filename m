That was me. It will probably be later today or Friday before I've had
time to review the code.  For reference look for string memory_less in
arch/ia64/mm/discontig.c.

The short story is HP ships NUMA boxes with interleaved memory only by
default which is represented by a single memory only node. Originally all
the CPU nodes where assigned to the memory node. The code was very
complicated and incorrect to me. Subsequently, and what we have now, the CPU
only nodes are revealed and the memory only node too. I do believe that a
cpu only nodes should be possible but now there seems to be a new issue.
