Per my previous message, I think there may be two related issues:
- mount hanging when no NFS4 root is defined, reproducible on .30
- state errors occurring in that situation, which may have been
  introduced with .31

I've just checked and when I saw the state errors I was running .31-rc3 on
the client, and partially also on the server. I saw error 2, 5 and 10022.
See log below.

I first switched back to .30 on the server to see if that fixed the mount
problem (it didn't) and later also switched back to .30 on the client.

(Sorry for the kernel version confusion, but I've been working on
different issues requiring frequent reboots; but I hope the info helps.)

Cheers,
FJP

Unrelated, but I just noticed the following on the server (with 2.6.30);
not sure what exactly triggered that, maybe a stop/start of the NFS services:
