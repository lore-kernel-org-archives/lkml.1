Following from gendisk or whatever high level object to lower level
object.  open is most common but there are other places.

Yes it is (where did I say they weren't?) but different in that it is
a severing boundary for module reference and thus can't tell its
creator when it's dying.

No, it's not.  If it were, we wouldn't be arguing.  :-)

The duality is ugly alright and will probably need a big fat comment
to explain what's going on but the current situation isn't too pretty
(or at least convenient) either.

Yes, that will be great too.  I'm just unhappy with the current
situation which is in the middle of the two sane positions where
drivers have to worry about whether high level object is valid or not.
If it's either always valid or can be told to go away into oblivion
(proper severing, no ->release necessary at all), I won't have any
complaint.

Thanks.
