No this commit is a serious bug, and the only fix is like you suggested
in __end_that_request_first. This is because it breaks that scsi-ml loop
where scsi_bufflen() can be less then blk_rq_bytes(). In that case this 
commit is a data corruption.

Submitted is the right fix to this problem, as pointed out by TOMO.
Please test it solves the CD burning problem.
(The patch includes the revert of commit e97a294e)

Subject: [PATCH] blk: missing add of padded bytes to io completion byte count

the commit e97a294ef6938512b655b1abf17656cf2b26f709 was very wrong. This is
because scsi-ml supports the ability to split a request into smaller chunks,
in which case scsi_bufflen() is smaller then request length. Then at completion
time the remainder can be issued as a new scsi command. In that case the above
commit is a data corruption.

Also in this fix all users of block layer are taken care of, and not only
scsi devices.
