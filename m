No problem, it never hurts to spell things out in detail :)

Sure, I understand this.

If the link name on disk is corrupted and the last character is not a
zero then it may be changed. That is information lost, albeit probably
not *useful* information. I wouldn't like to make such a change
without an OK from the FS maintainers, but I'll happily do it with
one. So far we seem to have one vote in favour and none against. :)

Note that the corruption doesn't have to be intentional, of course,
although it was in the particular bug report I was looking at
originally.

If the data on disk is corrupted such that i_size == PAGE_SIZE then
again we would have different data in-memory and on-disk. However in
this case the page would only contain the link name and so wouldn't be
dirtied and written out unless the name was changed anyway. So I
agree, it should be safe in this case, regardless of my concerns
above.

Thanks,
Duane.
