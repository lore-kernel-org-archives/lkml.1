Hmm, I find your data very weak for such a conclusion. Value of the test
itself withstanding, AS seems to be a lot faster for sequential output
for some reason, yet slower for everything else. Which is odd, deadline
should always be running at the same speed for writeout as AS. The only
real difference should be sequential and random reads.

So allow me to call your results questionable. It also looks like bonnie
(some version) output, I never found bonnie to provide good and
repeatable numbers. tiotest is much better, or (of course) fio.
