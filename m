I was afraid of that.  Not understanding how the reap_ref counts are 
supposed to work makes it hard to get them right...

Removal of the _target_, not the host.  (Do targets ever get reaped
from non-process context?  I didn't notice any places where that would
happen.)

That's part of the problem.  The other part is that the target isn't
unregistered until all the sdevs have been released, which might not
happen for a long time if the sdevs are pinned for any reason.

That is, the target should be unregistered when all the sdevs are
deleted, in __scsi_remove_device(), not when scsi_device_dev_release()  
or scsi_device_dev_release_usercontext() runs.

This may well fix Kay's problem, but I think the other point needs to 
be addressed also.
