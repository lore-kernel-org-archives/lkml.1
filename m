Nope, the last issue we had came from 2.6.28.9.

We upgraded to 2.6.30.3 on the advice of Jan, then we "upgraded" to=20
2.6.30.3 with the first Jan's patch to add some debug output=20
(0001-ext3-Debug-unlinking-of-inodes.patch). Finally we upgraded to=20
2.6.30.4 with the first and the second Jan's patch=20
(0001-fs-Make-sure-data-stored-into-inode-is-properly-see.patch) to add=20
a smp_mb() in the unlock_new_inode() function.

Same here, everything is fine since 2.6.30. We will switch back to the=20
quad-core server where the corruption happen(ed) in a few days. We are=20
now using a bi-opteron server because we suspected hardware issues on=20
the quad-core, the corruption happened only one time on the bi-opteron=20
(which is IMHO a sufficient evidence to discard hardware issue). I guess=20
the issue was(or is) kinda SMP related.

And yep, we also had long times playing with fsck ;-) Luckily that the=20
corruption only occurs on new files, and new files are mostly caches,=20
sessions, logs, and such, so fsck used its chainsaw on quite=20
not-really-important files.

The few garbaged inodes from 2.6.28.9 (and previous) were pushed to=20
lost+found to prevent future use of them. We do a fsck when we moved to=20
2.6.30.4 that fixed everything. We never had corruption yet with the=20
2.6.30.4.
