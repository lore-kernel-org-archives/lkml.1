The filesystem must send at least one unbuffered synchronous write
before it can send a trim for those blocks so the drive will not
release the blocks until we are certain they will not be needed again.

AKA the metadata consistency problem for crash recovery.

So non-delayed trim must at least be preceded by a write, but you
are correct that reads could be after the trim if the filesystem
does not have a multi-stage delete that requires a second synchronous
write, or if the trim can be held until all filesystem writes occur.

How hard it will be to "send the trim last" will be different for
each filesystem and some developers are already working on that.
