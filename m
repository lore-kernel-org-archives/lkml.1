I object to misleading and dangerous documentation that you have 
proposed. I spend a lot of time working in data integrity, talking and 
writing about it so I care deeply that we don't misinform people.

In this thread, I put out a draft that is accurate several times and you 
have failed to respond to it.

The big picture that you don't agree with is:

(1) RAID (specifically MD RAID) will dramatically improve data integrity 
for real users. This is not a statement of opinion, this is a statement 
of fact that has been shown to be true in large scale deployments with 
commodity hardware.

(2) RAID5 protects you against a single failure and your test case 
purposely injects a double failure.

(3) How to configure MD reliably should be documented in MD 
documentation, not in each possible FS or raw device application

(4) Data loss occurs in non-journalling file systems and journalling 
file systems when you suffer double failures or hot unplug storage, 
especially inexpensive FLASH parts.
