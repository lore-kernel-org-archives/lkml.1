Well, since the times reported by ls -l --full-time are sane
[root@coyote pix]# ls -l --full-time
total 924784
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root     985324 2002-06-09 18:14:54.000000000 -0400

[... the rest of a 100k listing, booted to 2.6.20.3-rdsl-0.31]

And:
[root@coyote pix]# ls -l --full-time
total 924784
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root     985324 2002-06-09 18:14:54.000000000 -0400

booted to 2.6.21-rc4

allthough the fractional second is a string of .000000000, even when 
booted to a tar-unfriendly kernel, then it would tend to point at tar, 
but two differently built versions of tar have been confirmed as 
miss-behaving in the presence of a kernel in the 2.6.21 series so far, 
all of them.

I'm going to reboot twice more tonight, once to verify that the output of 
an ls -l --full-time is as I said above, I'll save this and do that again 
and clip it in after a reboot to 2.6.21-rc4, and once to 2.6.20.4-rc1 to 
see if by chance one of those patches is the guilty party.  I'll leave 
the latter running tonight for the amanda run & see what falls out.
