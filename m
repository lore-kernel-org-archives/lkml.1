We are talking about a patch to kconfig, and the users using 
pre-compiled kernels are not kconfig users.

Couldn't we just remove kconfig and assume that all "people who already 
know the kernel" anyway prefer to edit their .config using vi?  ;-)

In my experience, the vast majority of kconfig users are not the few 
people working on distribution kernels, most of the kconfig userbase 
could be better described by the use case "sysadmin who knows about the 
hardware in his machine and which filesystems he uses".

And there must have been a reason why a leading kernel developer has 
written a complete book covering only configuration and building of the
kernel - the target audience of this book are most likely not "people 
who already know the kernel".
