Hmm...I've never used this, but in kmem_cache_alloc():

        /*
         * Enable redzoning and last user accounting, except for caches with
         * large objects, if the increased size would increase the object size
         * above the next power of two: caches with object sizes just above a
         * power of two have a significant amount of internal fragmentation.
         */
        if (size < 4096 || fls(size - 1) == fls(size-1 + REDZONE_ALIGN +
                                                2 * sizeof(unsigned long long)))
                flags |= SLAB_RED_ZONE | SLAB_STORE_USER;


...looks like it specifically excludes some caches.
