Hmm..., strange. We are getting different results.  May be it is some
configuration/setup issue.

How does your ioband setup looks like. Have you created at least one more
competing ioband device? Because I think only in that case you have got
this ad-hoc logic of waiting for the group which has not finished the
tokens yet and you will end up buffering the bio in a FIFO.

If you have not already done, can you just create two partitions on your
disk, say sda1 and sda2. Create two ioband devices with weights say 95
and 5 (95% of disk for first partition and 5% for other) and then run
the above test on first ioband device.

So how does this proportional weight thing works. If I have got two ioband
devices with weight 80 and 20 and if there is no IO happening on the
second device, first devices should get all the BW?

I will re-run my tests.

Secondly from technical point of view how do you explain the fact that
FIFO release of bio does not break the notion of CFQ priority? The moment
you buffered the bios in a single queue and started doing FIFO dispatch,
you lost that notion of one bio being more important than other.

That's a different thing that in practice it might not be easily visible.
