i just did some direct measurements of alternatives_smp_switch() itself:

 alternatives took: 7374 usecs
 alternatives took: 8775 usecs
 alternatives took: 7498 usecs
 alternatives took: 8776 usecs

that's on a ~2GHz Athlon64 X2 - so not the latest hw.

i also added a sysctl to turn alternatives patching on/off, and the CPU 
offline+online cycle:

  # alternatives on:
  real    0m0.152s
  real    0m0.172s

  # alternatives off:
  real    0m0.146s
  real    0m0.168s

so it's measurable and it is in the few milliseconds range. (But there 
seems to be strong dependency on the kernel image layout or some other 
detail - compare these timings to my previous timings - they were 
radically different.)
