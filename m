Today, I tested 2.6.24 kernel and ran LTP inside container, and found that
the above failure is still existing.
These failures are not occuring when i run LTP in parent namespace.

I verified, the above patch is still not applied with 2.6.24 kernel.

Parden me ! if i have missed some earlier mail thread.

But one good thing, no syslog failure :)
