Actually, it's pretty difficult to review a 17 patch series like this
because the human mind (or at least mine) doesn't retain sufficient
context from patch to patch.  I ended up just pulling all 17 into a tree
and reviewing the finished driver.

That said:

in hpsa.c:

We already have a host scan attribute which (admittedly using the
transport class logic) you can plug into ... can't you just use it?  It
supplies user context, so you could dispense with all that scan thread
stuff as well, I think.

These names are too generic.  We already have a scan_mutex at least
defined at the top level.  I know they're protected by static, but that
doesn't necessarily help if they show up in a debug stack trace.

All of this report luns stuff looks fairly identical to the report luns
we do in scsi_scan.c ... barring the initial command, which could be
translated.  Wouldn't it be easier to have the generic code parse and do
all of this?

I think you want to return SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY here, which will
trigger a throttle and retry after either something frees or I/O
pressure builds more.

So the first thing we do after a device reset successful return is send
a test unit ready to the failing device ... there's no real need for you
to duplicate that, is there?

The ioctl stuff looks like you could do it all with SG_IO now rather
than rolling your own versions ... or is there some backward
compatibility problem here?

msleep(500) please ..  This isn't the only place this occurs, could you
replace all of them?

Traditionally we've shied away from putting ASC/ASCQ values into
defines ... but these all look to be global not hpsa local, so they
should be in a common central file.

Otherwise looks OK to a cursory glance.
