it's in drivers/lguest ... apparently it's vring now and the code is in
driver/virtio

Not sure about Xen ... KVM uses virtio above.

Multiple rings is really just a multiqueue abstraction.  That's fine,
but it needs a standard multiqueue control plane.

The desire to one up the competition by adding a new whiz bang feature
to which you code a special interface is very common in the storage
industry.  The counter pressure is that consumers really like these
things standardised.  That's what the transport class abstraction is all
about.

We also seem to be off on a tangent about hypervisor interfaces.  I'm
actually more interested in the utility of an SRP abstraction or at
least something SAM based.  It seems that in your driver you don't quite
do the task management functions as SAM requests, but do them over your
own protocol abstractions.
