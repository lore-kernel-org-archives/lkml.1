Thanks for the kind words...  The above-mentioned test verified that the
bisection was/is correct: 2f1f53bdc6531696934f6ee7bbdfa2ab4f4f62a3 works,
and 6f37ac793d6ba7b35d338f791974166f67fdd9ba doesn't.  Now I've got to
figure out why.

"git diff 2f1f53bdc6531696934f6ee7bbdfa2ab4f4f62a3 6f37ac793d6ba7b35d338f791974166f67fdd9ba"
produced a relatively short patch (18,437 bytes).  The list of involved
files:

Current state of the source tree is the 6f37ac... version, so I'll start
backing out the above diffs in related groups and continue until I've got
a working kernel.  For lack of an obvious target, I'll start with the
seemingly innocuous change to sysctl_check.c.  I'll report back when I've
got something.
