The module aims to detect corruption, not prevent or recover from it. If the
write bio returns an error, it should be properly handled and propagated to
the upper layers.

If it returns success but writes the wrong data to the disk, then there will
be a mismatch between the checksum and the data at the destination, which will
be detected when it is read.

If a write returns success but no write ever takes place on the disk, then
dm-csum (as it is now) will not detect it; although I'm not sure if that
qualifies as on-disk data corruption or is it a disk controller issue.

The code considers the possibility of bios failing, and propagates this
information to the upper layers. If you see any part of the code that lacks
error handling, please let me know so I can fix it.

M1 and M2 refer to whole IMD sectors.

It's per IMD sector. More specifically, struct imd_sector_header's
last_updated contains the generation count for the entire IMD sector, which is
used to determine which one is younger for updating purposes.

On reads, both IMD sectors are loaded and CRCs are verified against both.

Thanks a lot,
