For the test runs being done here, there's a pretty high chance that all
of the inodes you read ahead will get used before the pages are dropped,
so we want to find a balance between those and the worst case workloads
where inode reads are basically random.  One good data point is the
completion time for IOs of different sizes.

I used fio to measure the latencies on O_DIRECT randomreads of given
sizes on a fast 500GB sata drive.  Here is the output for a 4k run (I
used elevator=noop, but cfq was about the same):

f4k: (groupid=6, jobs=1): err= 0: pid=22877
  read : io=15816KiB, bw=539KiB/s, iops=131, runt= 30004msec
    clat (usec): min=555, max=20909, avg=7581.38, stdev=2475.88
     issued r/w: total=3954/0, short=0/0
     lat (usec): 750=0.03%
     lat (msec): 2=0.03%, 4=7.08%, 10=71.60%, 20=21.24%, 50=0.03%

clat is completion latency, but note fio switches between usec and msec
just to keep us on our toes.  Other important numbers are iop/s and
total issued ios.  The test limits the run on each IO size to 30
seconds.

The 4k run gets 131 iop/s, so my sata drive can read 131 inodes/second
in a worst case random workload.  iop rates for the others:

4k	131
8k	130
16k	128
32k	126
64k	121
128k	113
256k	100

A slightly trimmed job output is below, and the fio job file I used is
attached if anyone wants to try this on their own machines.  I'd stick
with either 32k or 64k as the sweet spots, but a tunable is definitely a
good idea.
