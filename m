Note that "try it and see what breaks" isn't reliable either. If glibc
gets back a 64 bit inode number that just happens to fit in the 32-bit
field, then everything will work. You don't actually get an EOVERFLOW
until st_ino overflows the field, and that may not happen often enough
for testing this way to detect it...
