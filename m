Good catch!  Did you actually run across this in practice?  I would've
thought it relatively unusual to have a lockd that didn't receive its
first lock request until 25 days after startup.

I've actually had a patch that does roughly the same thing for a while
at:

	git://linux-nfs.org/~bfields/linux.git failover

3ff893a7.. "lockd: don't depend on lockd main loop to end grace" but
hadn't submitted it since I didn't see the bug you found.  (I had other
reasons I wanted to do this).  Difference that I can see off-hand:

	- I used schedule_delayed_work instead of a timer.
	- I forgot to delete the thing before exiting!

So I think my solution has a bug that yours doesn't.  (I don't see what
would stop the module being removed before my work gets scheduled.)

I still have a mild preference for a work struct just in case we end up
wanting to do something slightly more complicated to end the grace
period, but I don't really have anything in mind.
