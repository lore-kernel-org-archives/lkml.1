Something like bus matching would be nice. I think this is going to be a 
bigger problem in the future with everyone putting as many functions on 
a card as possible. We already have the cxgb3 net driver with a iwarp 
(iw_cxgb3) and iscsi (cxgb3i) driver, so maybe something in the net or 
driver model code would be best?

Today, you can't have two pci_drivers attaching to the same device can you?
