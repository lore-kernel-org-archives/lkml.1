I'm not sure how verbose we want to be with printk's;  it's a dilemma.
Any verbiage suggesting that strictly growing the partition is safe
would be welcome, but I agree, that's tough to convey at this point.

I guess I'm okay with things as they stand, but I do think this will
generate customer calls.  ;)
