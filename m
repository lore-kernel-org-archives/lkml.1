They issue async I/O before they sleep and expects
processing to be done on I/O completion via workqueues.

We don't suspend the threads on a filesystem freeze - they continue
run. A filesystem freeze guarantees the filesystem clean and that
the in memory state matches what is on disk. It is not possible for
the filesytem to issue I/O or have outstanding I/O when it is in the
frozen state, so the state of the threads and/or workqueues does not
matter because they will be idle.

Cheers,

Dave.
