Well, there's a lot more reasons than just an outstanding command. The
biggest issue is when there has been a downstream reference to it - such
as by a filesystem or DM object.

Some of the headaches have been these downstream references that are never
released. Ex: DM does not expect devices to come and go yet.

Keep thinking about DM references. So... it isn't quite gone from the
system.

So nothing you've described so far, including your patch, is different
from the discussion in this thread: http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=115582805811406&w=2
which terminates with a recommendation from James B to avoid this kind of
patch as there's also a lurking issue with the SDEV_CANCEL state.

Given that since this thread:
- the consensus was to resurrect the sdev from the SDEV_DEL state back
   to SDEV_RUNNING
      http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=117139230702785&w=2
- that patches for the resurrection where implemented post this thread
   and are in the upstream kernel
      http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=117991046126294&w=2
- and given there is still a set of resurrection fixes outstanding
      http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=118215727101887&w=2

I don't see any future for your patch.

Please apply the oustanding resurrection patch set and see if the proper
behavior occurs. If it doesn't, please post to l-s again and I'm sure
Hannes and I can consider it further.

This is somewhat of a different argument. We should answer/solve the resurrection
problem, then see where things lead us.
