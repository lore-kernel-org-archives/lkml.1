I agree I sent this as an RFC to show the overall changes.
I do plan to include the following two patches, which should address
the issue of ->nsproxy being NULL.

Yes, I agree and am trying to solve only those two :-) I moved out
changes to __do_notify() and others to separate patches, but maybe
we can simplify this patch further.

| 
| As for .si_pid mangling, this again needs a separate patch.

I thought we were going to use SIG_FROM_USER to decide if the siginfo
does in fact have a ->si_pid (so we don't need the switch statement
we had in an earlier patch).

|

No problem. Thanks for the comments so far.

Maybe in a separate patch, but same_ns is needed to ensure container-init
does not ignore signals from ancestor namespace - no ? 

I was undecided between the above sig_kernel_only() check and 
'handler == SIG_DFL' (hence the TODO).

Right I used is_container_init() since it includes global init().
Again, maybe it could have been separate patches for just global_init
first.

But I see from your patch that we could use SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE instead
of is_container_init(). That is more efficient.

|

Ok. I will review that.

| ->nsproxy may be NULL, but we can use task_pid(t)->numbers[-1].ns

Eric's patch of generalizing task_active_pid_ns() should fix this. It
was reviewed several times, so I did not send it, but yes, I should
have mentioned it.

Ok.

Good point. We had gone back and forth on this and I thought one of the
emails mentioned this check. Maybe I misread that.

But yes, its not needed since send_signal() does it.
