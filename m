Hmm.. I personally will call it a bug in XFS code then. :)

I understand. May be we can confirm once more with David Chinner if this
is really required. Will it really be a compatibility issue if new XFS
preallocations (ie. via fallocate) update mtime/ctime ? Will old
applications really get affected ? If yes, then it might be worth
implementing - even though I personally don't like it.

David, can you please confirm ? Thanks!
