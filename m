Is the suggestion that in case of a clash just change the message string
slightly to avoid the clash ?

This is very true. If a message is touched most likely the message
description has to be changed as well. If the message hash then changes
the tools can warn about it. The small thing now only is the matter of
actually implementing the hash and changing the script to work on them..
