I think we've already established that the code in question is correct
and functional, 

As far as I can tell, virtual merging has always been broken on ppc, so
it shouldn't enable it.  It looks like at some point in history sparc
went from a working vmerge to a non working one (by copying the broken
ppc code), so the correct fix for both of these arches is simply to turn
off virtual merging.

ppc claims to turn off virtual merging, but in fact the define is
broken.  Sparc should now follow ppc.

Try this patch
