So perhaps this routine should only note but not advise?  The drivers
can then just call pci_interrupt_type to see if they can do anything.

The only thing that this can't do is ACPI ... but on the other hand once
the IRQ routing is set by ACPI I'm not sure the driver can do anything
to fix it.

So ... depending on how the feedback goes, I'll plan to reroll this as a
note but not advise function.
