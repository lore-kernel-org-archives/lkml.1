Bart, what is your role in the SCST project?  You don't seem to have
contributed any code to it (going by the SVN logs on sourceforge), and
your questions and suggestions seem to be those of someone not familiar
with the code.  If you're not a developer, it might be more helpful for
you to step back and let Vladislav handle this.
