True.   I guess what I was seeing was not a code but a usages
restriction which may not be enforced.

If we are using sysfs_get_dentry the sd is not deleted because
it is alive and being used, likewise the path to it should also be
alive.  Once you add in classic unix delete behaviour allowing for
alive but deleted files this no longer applies.  But I don't think
that makes sense for sysfs, but I may be confused.

Reasonable.  The reason I kept the climbing up was the performance
benefit I saw.

Sure.

Ok.

I'd like to make certain we have a path to tagged support or something
like it if we can.
