From: John Anthony Kazos Jr. <jakj@j-a-k-j.com>

Add helper functions "upper_32_bits" and "lower_32_bits" to 
<include/linux/kernel.h> to allow 64-bit integers to be separated into 
their 32-bit upper and lower halves without promoting integers, without 
stretching sign bits, and without generating compiler warnings when used 
with any integer not greater than 64 bits wide. High-order bits are 
assumed to be zero for integers with fewer than 64 of them.

Using these functions with signed quantities is an error, especially if 
you read a 32-bit quantity from disk that happens to have the high bit set 
into an int on a 32-bit machine, then use it with a function taking a u64 
which screws your data. When switching to using these functions, it's a 
good opportunity to check for these signedness errors. (Haven't we learned 
anything over the past decades of computing about assuming that one little 
bit doesn't matter?)

Not sure exactly whom the maintainer is for this, so I added 
trivial@kernel.org. It's certainly not limited to one subsystem anymore, 
and converting the whole kernel to this could be a good step for 
readability and correctness across architectures of any word size.
