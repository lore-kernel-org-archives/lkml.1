Hello!

Here are more informations... the problem seems to be a little bit more 
special.

1.) I've bootet these systems through NFS and would like to access 
/dev/sda or /dev/sdb then. For example via fdisk and this does not work.

2.) I've now tested the following kernels -
2.6.18.8 - works
2.6.19.7 - works
2.6.20 - does not work
2.6.21-rc4 - does not work

3.) The funny thing is, i can boot the whole system via 2.6.18.8 for 
example - fdisk the harddisk and format it + plus copying the whole 
image with a 2.6.20.3 kernel - and then the Server installied works 
perfectly i also can fdisk /dev/sdb or so. It only does not work if the 
system itself is bootet via NFS...
