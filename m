Yes, almost everything is in there now. Tony Luck told me he has integrated
the idle notifier for IA-64. I saw that the i386 version of the notifier
was recently integrated as well. So I think that for 2.6.21 we'll have
everything we need for i386, x86-64 and ia64. On MIPS and PowerPC,
a few things are still missing but they should be fixed soon.

On x86-64 and i386, the one last thing I would need that you do not already
have is in the NMI handler for the architectural perfmon to switch PERFCTR0
to PERFCTR1. This would allow certain events to be measured while the NMI
watchdog is active. This is needed on Intel Core-based processors where
certain events can ONLY be measured by PERFCTR0. The CPU_CLK_UNHALTED event
used by the watchdog can be measured by any counter.

I have attached the x86-64 patch for this. I can submit the i386 version
as well.

Not a problem.

Yes, all the changes and fixes you and Andrew had requested have been made.


changelog:
	- for architectural perfmon support, switch from PERFCTR0 to PERFCTR1.
	  this does free PERFCTR0 which is the only counter supported for certain
	  events on Intel Core-based processors.
