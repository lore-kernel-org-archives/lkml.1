It depends how it's done.  One way would be via a new
address_space_operations entry.

Well it _does_ sprinkle them all over.

Partly as a cleanup, yes.  But such a function then becomes a site
where we can add commentary explaining the reason for its existence,
along with commentary which describes the semantics in details,
exceptions, caveats, etc.

It also becomes a single site where the feature can be disabled for
those who wish to evaluate its performance cost.

The single site can also be used for convenient gathering of timing
information.

One thing we may well choose to do is to stop issuing the flush if
blkdev_issue_flush() is returning -EOPNOTSUPP, which some devices will
presumably do.  Reissuing a pointless and quite expensive command over
and over again doesn't seem clever.

And I can probably think of more reasons :)

It shouldn't be inlined.
