Thanks, yes I noticed that after you pointing this out.

But __journal_try_to_free_buffer() only unfile the buffer from
t_sync_datalist or t_locked list, the journal head is not removed in
journal_remove_journal_head() there, at that time,
journal_remove_journal_head() just check if counter b_jcount is 0. But
before calling __journal_try_to_free_buffer(), since
journal_try_to_free_buffers() already increase the b_jcount in
journal_grab_journal_head(), so the journal head is not removed in
__journal_try_to_free_buffer-> journal_remove_journal_head()

> So who's

Looking at the code, it seems the it's the journal_put_journal_head(jh)
who remove the journal head and decrease the bh

journal_try_to_free_buffers() 
{
...

jh = journal_grab_journal_head(bh);
                if (!jh)
                        continue;

                jbd_lock_bh_state(bh);
                __journal_try_to_free_buffer(journal, bh);
                journal_put_journal_head(jh);
                jbd_unlock_bh_state(bh);

...

}
 so when journal_put_journal_head()-> __journal_remove_journal_head(),
now the b_jcount is zero, but is  
jh->b_transaction is NULL? So it seems possible that bh ref count is non
zero when exit from journal_put_journal_head() if jh_b_transaction is
not cleared.

I miss where jh->b_transaction is clear to NULL? 

void journal_put_journal_head(struct journal_head *jh)
{
        struct buffer_head *bh = jh2bh(jh);

        jbd_lock_bh_journal_head(bh);
        J_ASSERT_JH(jh, jh->b_jcount > 0);
        --jh->b_jcount;
        if (!jh->b_jcount && !jh->b_transaction) {
                __journal_remove_journal_head(bh);
                __brelse(bh);
        }
        jbd_unlock_bh_journal_head(bh);
}
