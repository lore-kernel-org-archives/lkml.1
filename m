I think that would be best, we don't want to encourage use of it, it's
not really clear to people how expensive it is unless they go and look
at it. The absolute worst case would be someone doing a

        for_each_sg(sgl, sg, nents) {
                ...
                if (sg == sg_last(sgl))
                        ...
        }

which would be absolutely awful.

But lets let things settle for a few days, then kill sg_last().
