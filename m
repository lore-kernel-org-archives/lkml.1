  Thanks for testing. So you seem to be really stressting the path where
creation of new files / directories fails (probably due to group quota).  I
have one idea what could cause your filesystem corruption, although it's a
wild guess... Please try attached oneliner.
  Also your corruption reminded me that Al Viro has been fixing problems
where we could cache one inode twice when a filesystem was mounted over NFS
and that could also lead to a filesystem corruption. So I'm adding him to
CC just in case he has some idea. BTW Al, what do you think about the
problem I describe in the attached patch? I'm not sure if it can cause some
real problems but in theory it could...

Subject: [PATCH] fs: Make sure data stored into inode is properly seen before unlocking new inode

In theory it could happen that on one CPU we initialize a new inode but clearing
of I_NEW | I_LOCK gets reordered before some of the initialization. Thus on
another CPU we return not fully uptodate inode from iget_locked().
