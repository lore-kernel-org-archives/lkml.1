Thank you for creating a patch !!

I tested it, and it works fine.

My environment is following,
LTTV 0.12.10
LTTng 0.100
LTT Control 0.65
Kernles 2.6.29

LTTng version is old now, but the test is passed on ARM11 target.

Furthermore, I run the splice test and the test is passed too.
The test code is copied from
http://kzk9.net/blog/2007/05/splice2.html
(Japanese page)

Thanks all people who commented this issue.

Best regards,
Masahiro Tamori
