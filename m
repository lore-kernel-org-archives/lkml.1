Ok, that's a little odd.  (correlates with the "bad" magic that was
seen, because block 0 is the superblock, but doesn't make sense because
we were trying to read a directory leaf block, in theory)

If you unmount & remount, does the ls work then?

Thanks.

xfs_repair on x86 shows no errors; however it won't mount normally (bad
log clientid) - but mount -o norecovery,ro and subsequent ls works fine
(at first I thought filenames were badly scrambled but then remembered
that xfs_metadump does this by default ;))

The remaining problem that I know of on some arm architectures is a vmap
cache aliasing problem that usually shows up as log corruption; that may
explain the bad clientid thing but not sure why we're reading block 0 above.

Do you know what cachepolicy you're booted with?  If it's writeallocate,
you might try cachepolicy=writeback, otherwise try cachepolicy=uncached
(which will be horribly slow) and see if the problem goes away or not;
it'd be a clue.
