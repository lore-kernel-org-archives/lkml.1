Tony can only speculate because this bit has been in asm/mman.h
since before I started working on Linux (it is in the 2.4.0
version ... which is roughly when I started ... and long before
I was responsible for it).

Perhaps it was assumed that it would be useful?  Linux/ia64 does
use upwardly growing memory areas (the h/w register stack engine
saves "stack" registers to an area that grows upwards).

But since we have survived this long without it actually being
implemented, it may be true that we don't really need it after
all.
