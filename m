Yeah, it needs to be generalized to its own cgroup so that it doesn't 
depend on both CONFIG_CPUSETS or CONFIG_CGROUP_MEM_RES_CTLR.  If we get 
the dirty and writeback page statistics added to memcg, this becomes much 
simpler.

Yeah, this could enable one of the workarounds that Christoph earlier 
described: the oom handler has the ability to notify userspace and allows 
it to defer invoking the oom killer if there's an alternative way to 
remedy the situation.  So the oom handler posted to linux-mm could work by 
doing a sync anytime it ran low on memory, but the objective of this 
patchset is different.

The idea here is to implement per-cpuset (and now per-memcg) dirty and 
background dirty ratios to avoid using the global sysctls.  This is 
currently problematic for users of cpusets who divide their machine for 
batches of tasks, usually for NUMA optimizations: a cpuset, for example, 
can represent 40% of the system's memory and if the global dirty ratio is 
set to 50%, we still won't begin writeback even if all the memory in the 
cpuset is dirty.

Andrea, what's the status of the patch to add dirty and writeback 
statistics to memcg?  I don't see it in the October 30 mmotm or any 
followup discussion on it.

Is this possible in a second version?
