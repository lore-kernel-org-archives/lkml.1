Thanks,

One thing that I thought about fixing is that we could falsely
increase bi_seg_front_size and bi_seg_back_size in
ll_merge_requests_fn() though I chose the same way in which we did for
hw merging.

We might update bi_seg_front_size and bi_seg_back_size if
blk_phys_contig_segment() succeeds. But if total_phys_segments check
fails after blk_phys_contig_segment(), we could falsely increase
bi_seg_front_size and bi_seg_back_size.

But falsely increasing bi_seg_front_size and bi_seg_back_size doesn't
cause any bug. It just means we have less segments. So I let it
alone.


Oh, I forgot to say, I was able to reproduce the bug easily and wow
this patch seems to fix the bug for me.
