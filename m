I think there might be a related usecase that could benefit from=20
TRIM/UNMAP/whatever support in file systems even if the physical devices do=
=20
not support that. I have a RAID5 at work with LVM over it. This week I dele=
ted=20
an old logical volume of some 200GB that has been moved to a different volu=
me=20
group, tomorrow I will start to replace all the disks in the raid with bigg=
er=20
ones. So if the LVM told the raid "hey, this space is totally garbage from =
now=20
on" the raid would not have to do any calculation when it has to rebuild th=
at=20
but could simply write fixed patterns to all disks (e.g. 0 to first data, 0=
 to=20
second data and 0 as "0 xor 0" to parity). With the knowledge that some of =
the=20
underlying devices would support "write all to zero" this operation could b=
e=20
speed up even more, with "write all fixed pattern" every unused chunk would=
 go=20
down to a single write operation (per disk) on rebuild regardless which par=
ity=20
algorithm is used.

And even if things are in use the RAID can benefit from such things. If we=
=20
just define that every unmapped space will always be 0 when read and I writ=
e=20
to a raid volume and the other part of the checksum calculation is unmapped=
=20
checksumming becomes easy as we already know half of the values before: 0. =
So=20
we can save the reads from the second data stripe and most of the calculati=
on.
"dd if=3D/dev/md0" on an unmapped space is more or less the same as "dd=20
if=3D/dev/zero" than.

I only fear that these things are too obviously as I would be the first to=
=20
have this idea ;)

Greetings,

Eike
