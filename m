  But what is the problem with using the filesystem ids? All virtual
machines in my example should have a notion of those...

  Yes, that could also be a solution.

  Yes, we'd just assign the attribute a different number and teach
userspace about the new attribute format...

  Maybe write him an email or go and bang him with a baseball bat ;)
Seriously, if someone (like admin) is able to find a physical identity of the
guilty user, then we should be able to do this in a software too, shouldn't
we?
