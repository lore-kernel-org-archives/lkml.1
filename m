There's no real difference; patches I've been planning on submitting for
2.6.28 follow.

(We could submit a patch for 2.6.27, since it's a bugfix, but this isn't
a new regression, so existing users at least won't be made any worse
off, and this doesn't crash the server, or anything similarly drastic.
It's still serious, just not quite serious enough to submit at this
point in the release cycle, as I understand the rules....)
