Hi Muli,

Agree, using old kernel's TCE tables is a hack. As Eric pointed out,
is there a reason why swiotlb will not work here? (I guess using
swiotlb will mean disabling iommu and that will again fault if 
DMA is going on).

So one of the solutions, as eric suggested,  will be to reserve some
entries in first kernel and then pass that info to second kernel and
let second kernel use thos entries for setting up DMA and let the
DMA's of first kernel run untouched.

This patch is effectively doing that (using previous kernel's TCE table),
except the fact that there are no gurantees that there are free table
entries when kdump kernel wants to perform a DMA of its own. Should
probably work though in most of the cases.

Is there a reliable way of stopping all ongoing DMAs after kernel crash?

Thanks
