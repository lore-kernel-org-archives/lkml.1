Actually, MD does this scan already (not automatically, but you can set up a 
simple cron job to kick off a periodic "check"). It is a delicate balance to get 
the frequency of the scrubbing correct.

On one hand, you want to make sure that you detect errors in a timely fashion, 
certainly detection of single sector errors before you might develop a second 
sector level error on another drive.

On the other hand, running scans/scrubs continually impacts the performance of 
your real workload and can potentially impact your components' life span by 
subjecting them to a heavy workload.

Rule of thumb seems from my experience is that most people settle in with a scan 
once a week or two (done at a throttled rate).

Agreed....
