Was "0 is special" defined anywhere that I missed?

But again, you have to manually match up numbers by hand, that's prone
to get messy very quickly.

Why not have your example show this?

Um, isn't that the point?  If the code structure changes, then perhaps
the message also should change?  If not, it's trival to adjust.

Why would this matter?  It's just a "tag", who cares about the actual
name?
