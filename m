The softlockup threshold is 60 seconds.  For the kernel to spend 60
seconds continuous CPU time in the filesystem is very bad behaviour, and
adding a rescheduling point doesn't fix that!

I worry that something has gone wrong with the reservations code.  The
filesystem _should_ be able to find a free block without any contention
from other CPUs, because there's a range of blocks reserved for this
inode's allocation attempts.

Unless the workload has a lot of threads writing to the _same_ file. 
If it does that then yes, we'll have lots of CPUs contenting for blocks
within that inode's reservation window.  Tell us about the workload please.

But that shouldn't be happening either because all those write()ing
threads will be serialised by i_mutex.

So I don't know what's happening here.  Possibly a better fix would be
to add a lock rather than leaving the contention in place and hiding
it.  Even better would be to understand why the contention is happening
and prevent that.

Thanks.
