I wanted to see what you're saying and tried this test code below:

<test.c>
#include "stdio.h"

typedef unsigned char __u8;
typedef unsigned int __u32;

typedef struct { __u8 b[3]; } __be24, __le24;

#define __be24_to_cpu(x) \
({ \
	__be24 _x = (x); \
	(__u32) ((_x.b[0] << 16) | (_x.b[1] << 8) | (_x.b[2])); \
})

static inline __u32 be24_to_cpu(__be24 _x)
{
	return (__u32) ((_x.b[0] << 16) | (_x.b[1] << 8) | (_x.b[2]));
}

#define __cpu_to_be24(x) \
({ \
	__u32 _x = (x); \
	(__be24) { .b = { (_x >> 16) & 0xff, (_x >> 8) & 0xff, _x & 0xff } }; \
})

static inline __be24 cpu_to_be24(__u32 _x)
{
	__be24 be = {
		.b = { (_x >> 16) & 0xff, (_x >> 8) & 0xff, _x & 0xff } 
	};
	return be;
}

int test1(__u32 r)
{
	union {
		__be24 be17;
		__u32 be_as_u;
	} be = {.be_as_u = 0};

	be.be17 = cpu_to_be24(r);
	__u32 cpu = be24_to_cpu(be.be17) + 1;

	printf("cpu=%x be=%x\n",cpu, be.be_as_u);
	return cpu;
}

int test2(__u32 r)
{
	union {
		__be24 be17;
		__u32 be_as_u;
	} be = {.be_as_u = 0};

	be.be17 = __cpu_to_be24(r);
	__u32 cpu = __be24_to_cpu(be.be17) + 1;

	printf("cpu=%x be=%x\n",cpu, be.be_as_u);
	return cpu;
}

int main()
{
	__u32 r = rand();
	test1(r);
	test2(r);

	return 0;
}
</test.c>

I compile it like this:
$ gcc -O1 test.c -o test
if I
$ gdb test
gdb> disass test1
gdb> disass test2

I get the exact same assembly.

What am I doing wrong ?

$ gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20070925 (Red Hat 4.1.2-27)
