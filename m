This patch remains in a stalled state...

And then there's this:

: Probably a better fix would be to explicitly tell
: journal_try_to_free_buffers() when it need to block on journal commit,
: rather than (mis)interpreting the gfp_t in this fashion.  I assume the
: only caller who really cares is direct-io.  That would be quite a bit
: of churn, and the asynchronous behaviour perhaps makes sense _anyway_
: when called from page reclaim.
: 
: otoh, there is a risk that this change will cause page reclaim to sit
: there burning huge amounts of CPU time and not achieving anything,
: because all it is doing is scanning over busy pages.  In that case,
: blocking behind a commit which would make those pages reclaimable is
: correct behaviour.  But given that the offending code in
: journal_try_to_free_buffers() has only been there for a few weeks, I
: guess this isn't a concern.
: 
: 
: Really, I think what this patch tells us is that 3f31fddf ("jbd: fix
: race between free buffer and commit transaction") was an unpleasant
: hack which had undesirable and unexpected side-effects.  I think - that
: depends upon your as-yet-undisclosed testing results?
: 
: Perhaps we should revert 3f31fddf and have another think about how to
: fix the direct-io -EIO problem.  One option would be to hold our noses
: and add a new gfp_t flag for this specific purpose?
