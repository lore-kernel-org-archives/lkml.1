We have /sys/class/scsi_host/host*/sg_tablesize:

How about modifying this value on the fly?

fujita@clover:/sys/class/scsi_host/host3$ echo 1000 > sg_tablesize


Well, this needs more changes (to both the block layer and the scsi
mid layer) but is it nice to change this value dynamically?

Anyway, I think that it's better to address this fancy feature later
on (after the mainline inclusion). Let's put hpsa driver into mainline
first.

Oops, I meant that I might come back with a patch to convert hpsa to
use the the block layer tagging, which you and Mike Christie are
talking about (yeah, my first suggestion to use lists was wrong. using
the block layer tagging looks much better).


By the way, have you guys started to work on the review comments for
the next submission? The driver has some minor style issues that have
not been mentioned yet. For example, the comment style in the driver
is not preferred:

/* If this device a non-zero lun of a multi-lun device */
/* byte 4 of the 8-byte LUN addr will contain the logical */
/* unit no, zero otherise. */

The preferred style is:

/*
 * If this device a non-zero lun of a multi-lun device
 * byte 4 of the 8-byte LUN addr will contain the logical
 * unit no, zero otherise.
 */

Another example, I think that the SCSI-ml preferred style is (not
documented in CodingStyle though):

'if (!ptr)' rather than 'if (ptr == NULL)'
'if (!value)' rather than 'if (value == 0)'
'if (ptr)' rather than 'if (ptr != NULL)'
'if (value)' rather than 'if (value != 0)'


If you are already addressing the review comments, I just wait for the
next submission, then I'll send such minor patches. If you are not,
I'll send patches to address the review comments (including such minor
patches).
