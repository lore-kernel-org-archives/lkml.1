I cannot see that that would matter.
kobject_del deletes the object from the kobj tree and free sysfs.
export_rdev disconnects the objects from md structures and releases
the connection with the device.  They are quite independent.

Maybe it isn't there any more....

Once upon a time, when I 
   echo remove > /sys/block/mdX/md/dev-YYY/state

sysfs_write_file would hold buffer->sem while calling my store
handler.
When my store handler tried to delete the relevant kobject, it would
eventually call orphan_all_buffers which would try to take buf->sem
and deadlock.

orphan_all_buffers doesn't exist any more, so maybe the deadlock is
gone too.
However the comment at the top of sysfs_schedule_callback in
sysfs/file.c says:

 *
 * sysfs attribute methods must not unregister themselves or their parent
 * kobject (which would amount to the same thing).  Attempts to do so will
 * deadlock, since unregistration is mutually exclusive with driver
 * callbacks.
 *

so I'm included to leave the code as it is....  ofcourse the comment
could be well out of date.
