So show a specific device where the virtual merge accounting is useful.

(1) The device that is often used in alpha or pa-risc environments --- 
because the accounting is not used on other archs.

(2) The device that is performance-sensitive --- not something outdated or 
unusual.

(3) And the device that has limited sg-list size, so that generic I/O 
requests made by the kernel hit this limit. (if the sg-list is so big that 
nr_phys_segments of most requests fits into it, you don't need to count 
nr_hw_segments --- because nr_hw_segments < nr_phys_segments and 
nr_phys_segments already fits).

[ the device that traverses its sg-list slowly doesn't fall into category 
(3), beacuse virtual merging would happen with or without nr_hw_segments 
accounting ]
