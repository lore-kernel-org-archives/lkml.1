Sorry, I these traces confused me a bit. I had absolutely no idea about a 
possible reason.

This is this time easily visible from the traces (mptspi_dv_device) ;) So its 
the mpt driver, we are using LSI22320 cards (I CC'ed Eric).

Thats a clear "yes and no". Exactly this state we have got two or three times 
during an exhausting hardware stress test over the last weeks (with real and 
with simulated errors), but its not easily reproducible. Furthermore,  the 
hardware will go into production soon and I don't have the chance to simulate 
further errors.
However, we can easily get a similar state just on a raid6-rebuild (with high 
end hardware though. 
(You probably never won't run into into it with normal disks, we are doing 
software-raid over a bunch of several hardware raid systems).  

In the raid6-rebuild case the system is not completely locked up, just mostly. 
Somehow raid6-rebuild is still working, we can see this by the io usage 
status of the hardware-raids, but the system is completely blocked otherwise. 
Only pings and sysrq's are working.


Thanks,
Bernd
