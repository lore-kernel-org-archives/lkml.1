Actually, I think you were right. We still have this check in
generic_sync_sb_inodes() even with Wu's January 2008 patches:

	/* Was this inode dirtied after sync_sb_inodes was called? */
	if (time_after(inode->dirtied_when, start))
		break;

...this check is the crux of the problem. We're assuming that the
dirtied_when value will never appear to be in the future. If we change
this check so that it's checking that dirtied_when is between "start"
and "now", then this problem basically goes away.

We'll probably also need to change the test in move_expired_inodes
too, unless Wu's changes go in.
