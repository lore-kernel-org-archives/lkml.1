Yep.  

Sorry.  I didn't mean we should revert the hunk.  I was just trying to
help identify the cause of the new behavior.

I think this is a real problem albeit not a "serious" one.  Network
file-systems usually try to avoid readers seeing blocks of zeros in
files, especially in this simple writer/reader case.

It wouldn't be bad if the file is written out of order occasionally, but
we see this constantly now.

We cannot write/read log files to NFS mounts reliably any more.  That
seems like a valid use case which no longer works?

Anyway, thanks for your time!
