On top of every thing Jeff said, which I totally agree.

>From passed experience it is much (much^3) easier to start
from Linux, clean, then Port to windows, and maybe if you
are very very concerned, do it in parallel but first foot
in Linux.

This is because:
1. Windows code you don't have partners with, and they don't show.
   So a small HAL or Linux-shim layer will raise no eyebrows.
2. The Linux model is much simpler, so it is a good design strategy
   to start with the simple basics and add windows cross systems
   complexity ontop.
3. Coding style wise and layer abstraction is most natural when done
   Windows ontop Linux, then Linux ontop Windows.
   Trivial bad example:
   VOID KeQueryTickCount(OUT PLARGE_INTEGER TickCount)
   {
	*TickCount = current_time();
   }

   You do see how it would be just better to use current_time() everywhere
   then use KeQueryTickCount.

So if you do clean layered abstracted code, pure Linux, then port it
to Windows that should be strait forward and maintainable. But if you
do clean layered abstracted code, pure Windows, and port it to Linux
It will most definitely not be so easy or maintainable. And to get it
accepted you will need lots of back porting into the windows driver.

(Hell they don't even have a proper libc in Windows Kernel)
