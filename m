Yes.  I have.
I'm coding a prototype to be used by both this file system and by
the pnfs objects layout driver.
Initially it will do striping and mirroring, and RAID-5 parity as a
stretched goal for the initial release.

I agree.  osdfs is the name given by Avishay and IBM and we just adopted it.
I think that obfs (Object-based File System) would better represent
what it is (although it's still generic compared to boazfs :-)

I completely agree.  We've missed the merge window for 2.6.28 but
if we can get it into 2.6.29 that would be great!

Absolutely.
Thanks for your comments!
