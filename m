Any time you want to get the sysfs information for a filesystem which is 
already mounted, that's what you're forced to do.

I pointed out that having a way to map device numbers to sysfs 
directories would have the same effect, *and* would be usable for other 
purposes.  I'd rather see that than a new ioctl, and another, and another...

ioctl()s are also nasty since they're generally root-only (or rather, 
device-owner only).  Since the information is already in sysfs, there is 
no benefit to this hiding.  Otherwise one could consider a ioctl() "give 
me the sysfs name of this device."
