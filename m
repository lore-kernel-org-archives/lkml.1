I strongly second Kirill on this matter.

IMHO, we should _avoid_ as much as possible exposing internal kernel
state to applications, unless a _real_ need for it is _clearly_
demonstrated. The reasons for this are quite obvious.

It isn't strictly necessary to export a new interface in order to
support checkpoint/restart. **. Hence, I think that the speculation
"we may need it in the future" is too abstract and isn't a good
excuse to commit to a new, currently unneeded, interface. Should the
need arise in the future, it will be easy to design a new interface
(also based on aggregated experience until then).

** In fact, the suggested interface may prove problematic (as noted
earlier in this thread): if you first create the resource with some
arbitrary identifier and then modify the identifier (in our case,
IPC id), then the restart procedure is bound to execute sequentially,
because of lack of atomicity.

That said, I suggest the following method instead (this is the method
we use in Zap to determine the desired resource identifier when a new
resource is allocated; I recall that we had discussed it in the past,
perhaps the mini-summit in september ?):

1) The process/thread tells the kernel that it wishes to pre-determine
the resource identifier of a subsequent call (this can be done via a
new syscall, or by writing to /proc/self/...).

2) Each system call that allocates a resource and assigns an identifier
is modified to check this per-thread field first; if it is set then
it will attempt to allocate that particular value (if already taken,
return an error, eg. EBUSY). Otherwise it will proceed as it is today.

(I left out some details - eg. the kernel will keep the desire value
on a per-thread field, when it will be reset, whether we want to also
tag the field with its type and so on, but the idea is now clear).

The main two advantages are that first, we don't need to devise a new
method for every syscall that allocates said resources (sigh... just
think of clone() nightmare to add a new argument); second, the change
is incremental: first code the mechanism to set the field, then add
support in the IPC subsystem, later in the DEVPTS, then in clone and
so forth.
