Hence my observation that "the filesystem would need clear visibility into
exactly how these blocks are positioned".
If there is an FTL in the way that randomly relocates blocks, and a
power fail during write could corrupt data that appears to be
megabytes away in some unpredictable location, then yes: a log structure
won't help.

However I would like to imagine that even a cheep flash device, if it
only ever got writes that were exactly the size of the erase-block, would
not break those writes over multiple erase blocks, so some degree of
integrity and predictability could be preserved.  Even more so, I would
love to  be able to disable the FTL, or at least have clear and correct
documentation about how it works.

So yes, not a panacea.  But an avenue with real possibilities.
