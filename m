No, as long as the driver will err on underrun and overrun (of 56
bytes) and we only use those parts of the structure that lie within
the first 56 bytes, then I don't see how it could fail.

But it still makes the hairs on the back of my head stand on end to
see memory allocated, and pointed to by a "struct foo *", that is less
than "sizeof(struct foo)"...
