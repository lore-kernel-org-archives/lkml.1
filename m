The block layer doesn't give such guarentees, not for "regular" block
devices either. If the IO goes through the page cache then that will
serialize IO to a given page, but with eg O_DIRECT IO, you could have
the same block in flight several times. So if you are doing raw IO, the
application has to ensure ordering of the same block.
