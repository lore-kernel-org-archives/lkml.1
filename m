Checkpointing code checks it and may call log_wait_commit(), but this
problem is caused by transactions which have not started checkpointing.

For example, the tail transaction has an old update for block_B and
the running transaction has a new update for block_B.  Then, the
committing transaction fails to write the commit record, it aborts the
journal, and new block_B will be written back to the file system without
journaling.  Because this patch doesn't separate between normal abort
and checkpointing related abort, the tail transaction is left in the
journal space.  So by replaying the tail transaction, new block_B is
overwritten with old one.

It can happen in the case of the checkpointing related abort.
For example, assuming the tail transaction has an update for block_A,
the next transaction has an old update for block_B, and the running
transaction has a new update for block_B.
Now, the running transaction needs more log space, and it calls
log_do_checkpoint().  But it aborts the journal because it detected
write error on block_A.  In this case, new block_B will be
overwritten when the old block_B in the second transaction to the tail
is replayed.

Does this answer your question?
