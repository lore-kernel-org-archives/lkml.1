Hmm.., my old config had "AS" as default scheduler that's why I was seeing
the strange issue of RT task finishing after BE. My apologies for that. I
somehow assumed that CFQ is default scheduler in my config.

So I have re-run the test to see if we are still seeing the issue of
loosing priority and class with-in cgroup. And we still do..

2.6.30-rc4 with io-throttle patches
===================================
Test1
=====
- Two readers, one BE prio 0 and other BE prio 7 in a cgroup limited with
  8MB/s BW.

234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 55.8448 s, 4.2 MB/s
prio 0 task finished
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 55.8878 s, 4.2 MB/s

Test2
=====
- Two readers, one RT prio 0 and other BE prio 7 in a cgroup limited with
  8MB/s BW.

234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 55.8876 s, 4.2 MB/s
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 55.8984 s, 4.2 MB/s
RT task finished

Test3
=====
- Reader Starvation
- I created a cgroup with BW limit of 64MB/s. First I just run the reader
  alone and then I run reader along with 4 writers 4 times. 

Reader alone
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 3.71796 s, 63.0 MB/s

Reader with 4 writers
---------------------
First run
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 30.394 s, 7.7 MB/s 

Second run
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 26.9607 s, 8.7 MB/s

Third run
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 37.3515 s, 6.3 MB/s

Fourth run
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 36.817 s, 6.4 MB/s

Note that out of 64MB/s limit of this cgroup, reader does not get even
1/5 of the BW. In normal systems, readers are advantaged and reader gets
its job done much faster even in presence of multiple writers.   

Vanilla 2.6.30-rc4
==================

Test3
=====
Reader alone
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 2.52195 s, 92.9 MB/s

Reader with 4 writers
---------------------
First run
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 4.39929 s, 53.2 MB/s

Second run
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 4.55929 s, 51.4 MB/s

Third run
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 4.79855 s, 48.8 MB/s

Fourth run
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 4.5069 s, 52.0 MB/s

Notice, that without any writers we seem to be having BW of 92MB/s and
more than 50% of that BW is still assigned to reader in presence of
writers. Compare this with io-throttle cgroup of 64MB/s where reader
struggles to get 10-15% of BW. 

So any 2nd level control will break the notion and assumptions of
underlying IO scheduler. We should probably do control at IO scheduler
level to make sure we don't run into such issues while getting
hierarchical fair share for groups.
