I've not finished ioctls but my driver supports it partly.

Yeah, right. As you know, cciss doesn't have a global character device
for it so the tools don't work if no logical device exists.

udev rules can execute external programs. So you can make udev rules
do whatever you want.

Ideally, I think that the best solution is exporting a RAID device so
that the management tools can access to hardware via it (as other SCSI
drivers do). But we need the compatibility here. So I'm not sure. I'll
follow Mike's decision.
