The commit you found is a plausible source of the trouble (based on  
our current theory about the problem).

What isn't quite clear to me is whether this commit causes your user- 
space server to start failing suddenly, or it causes the client to  
start sending the special non-standard time stamps in the SETATTR  
request.  My guess is the latter, but I want to confirm this guess  
against reality  :-)

Are you running the client and server concurrently on the same  
system?  If so, it would be helpful if you could run this test with a  
constant kernel version on one side while varying it on the other.   
If client and server are already on different systems, can you tell  
us which system and which kernel combinations caused the failure?

A matrix of combinations might be:

1. server kernel is before 1c710c89, client kernel is before 1c710c89
2. server kernel is before 1c710c89, client kernel is after 1c710c89
3. server kernel is after 1c710c89, client kernel is before 1c710c89
4. server kernel is after 1c710c89, client kernel is after 1c710c89

Thanks.
