It was missing a list_entry() in fail_all_cmds(), apart from that it was
fine. I changed it to use hlist instead, as that is more appropriate and
similar to how it worked before. It also means there's no extra space
usage in the controller structure. I've tested it and it works fine for
me.

Mike, can you give this a look-over and give me a Reviewed-by or
similar? As an extra bonus, it also gets rid of some code.
