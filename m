The sg3_utils version 1.28 beta at http://sg.danny.cz/sg/
has a new sg_unmap utility and the previous release
included sg_write_same with Unmap bit support.
sg_readcap has been updated to show the TPE and TPRZ bits.

There is a new SCSI GET LBA STATUS command coming
(approved at the last t10 meeting, awaiting the next
SBC-3 draft). That will show the mapped/unmapped
status of logical blocks in a range of LBAs. I can
add a utility for that as well.
