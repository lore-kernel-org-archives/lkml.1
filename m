I doubt it's in the fc transport - it's doing what it always did, which has
nothing to do with coherency of the sdev's.

We're seeing like problems, and it looks like it's related to the scan_mutex
being held when some of the entry points are being called via the recent
async scan code (which also still has a bunch of issues around rmmod).
We should be sending some patches shortly.
