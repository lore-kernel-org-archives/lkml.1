Once a driver is in a tree it's in Git and git mv is easy. People 
working with Linux better familiarize themselves with Git workflow - the 
sooner the better.

If it's not in tree then it will adopt to whatever layout there is once 
it gets into Greg's tree. I dont see the problem.

Well, the answer is obvious i think. Tell me, at a glance, if you see a 
patch on lkml, which one is for a staging driver to be obsoleted, and 
which one is the one going upstream real soon? The patches say:

 +++ a/drivers/staging/foo/x.c

 +++ a/drivers/staging/bar/y.c

Then tell me the same at a glance if you see patches for:

 +++ a/drivers/staging/wip/x.c

 +++ a/drivers/staging/bad/y.c

It wont be 'ignored', as it's in every patch, it's in every commit, it's 
in every substantial communication about that driver.

The problem with feature-removal-schedule.txt is that it's too much out 
of sight and not part of the regular patch workflow. Same goes for any 
TODO file. Experience has shown that the actual _path_ were drivers end 
up does matter quite a bit, to general visibility and to mindset.

That's one of the reasons why we have _half a thousand_ directories in 
drivers/ to begin with. The directory namespace is very powerful, and we 
use it to convey all sorts of information about the logical category a 
driver is in.

Using it in drivers/staging/ instead of the current flat hierarchy would 
thus be pretty natural.
