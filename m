At the time, I asked him to split out the various changes into several
patches.

His patch did a lot of different things that would impact workloads in
different ways. For instance, while increasing the hash table size is
not likely to have a huge performance degradation for most people, the
change that decreases the garbage collection timeout is very likely to
cause issues (particularly with RPCSEC_GSS setups)...

OK. Could we please have some more details about the actual workload
involved here?
As far as I can see, there is no RPCSEC_GSS involved, so credentials
should never expire. They will be reused as long as processes aren't
switching between thousands and thousands of different combinations of
uid, gid and groups.
