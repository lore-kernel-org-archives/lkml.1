I don't think moving device_schedule_callback() is the answer.  For one 
thing, the implementation _has_ to be compiled in the calling module so 
that THIS_MODULE will have the correct value.  If it were compiled in 
drivers/base/core.c then it wouldn't refer to the caller's module.

The real problem is bad nesting of #includes.  Maybe changing 
include/asm-s390/hardirq.h not to include linux/interrupt.h will be 
feasible.

Or perhaps it would be better to move the definition of THIS_MODULE in
linux/module.h up before all the #include lines, since it seems reasonable
that a file indirectly included by module.h might need to use THIS_MODULE.
