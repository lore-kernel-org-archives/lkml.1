OK, so to summarize: when the rate of incoming rpc's is very high (and,
I guess, when we're serving everything out of cache and don't have IO
wait), all the nfsd threads will stay runable all the time.  That keeps
userspace processes from running (possibly for "minutes").  And that's a
problem even on a server dedicated only to nfs, since it affects portmap
and rpc.mountd.

The solution is given just as "limit the # of nfsd's woken but not yet
on CPU."  It'd be interesting to see more details.

Off hand, this seems like it should be at least partly the scheduler's
job.  E.g. could we tell it to schedule all the nfsd threads as a group?
I suppose the disadvantage to that is that we'd lose information about
how many threads are actually needed, hence lose the chance to reap
unneeded threads?
