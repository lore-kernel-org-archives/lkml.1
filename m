Thanks a lot for the feedback Andrew.

I've addressed your comments, details follow. I've also retested this change and implemented a minor optimization after which sequential read with metaclustering is slightly better than normal.

Thanks for pointing this out. ext3_count_free() now uses hweight*() functions.

Removed 'inline' keyword from all newly added functions except one (allow_mc_alloc()) which will most definitely get inlined.

Rewrote this function to search for a zero bit in strictly decreasing order of block numbers. The above code was doing the search in staircase pattern which was resulting in some unwanted fragmentation. The new code also improves sequential read performance slightly. Please take a look now.

As mentioned above, this code is gone now, new code doesn't have this inconsistency.

Agreed, it was not very useful / was an overkill, so nuked it.

This piece of code was simply a reshuffle of existing code. In particular, the new check_allocated_blocks() function contains only what the old ext3_new_blocks() used to have for checking newly allocated blocks. So I'd think we don't need explicit testing of these cases as such. But if you think I should test it, please let me know and I'll be glad to do so.

There are two main factors which are responsible for the way this patch was using bios.
(1) I initially started with what seemed like the most obvious choice to me, which is also what you suggested: issue read to each indirect block individually using submit_bh(). However, in my experiments I observed that coalescing of requests was sometimes suboptimal. I tried to investigate this behavior but gave up and started directly invoking bio layer to ensure maximum coalescing.
(2) The second problem I had was that bio layer would sometimes not behave correctly when invoked with a physically-discontiguous range of blocks, even though the interface suggests that this should work without any problems. Someone told me that it's "common understanding" that submit_bio() should only be used for a physically contiguous range. So I had to break the discontiguous requests into smaller contiguous requests which would each be sorted to be contiguous before invoking submit_bio.

I was not aware that Ext3 developers have put in a lot of effort to avoid directly accessing the bio layer. But now that you pointed this out, I went back and retried using submit_bh() for each buffer and turns out it's working fine now. So probably there was something amiss in my blktrace-based analysis previously which led me to believe that the IO stream going to disk is fragmented. The new patch uses submit_bh() here which makes it smaller by almost 300 lines of code.

Thanks for pointing this out, I had totally missed this issue in my change. I've now made the call to set_buffer_boundary() in ext3_get_blocks_handle() subject to metacluster option being set.
