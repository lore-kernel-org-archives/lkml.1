or is it possible since elv_dequeue_request BUG_ON check of queuelist did
not trigger a request is on the queuelist with a timeout_list not empty.

It would be interesting for a debug run to change the
"BUG_ON(!list_empty(&req->timeout_list))" in blk_add_timer to print out
the cmd_flags plus req->atomic_flags and also add a
"BUG_ON(!list_empty(&rq->timeout_list))" to elv_insert to ensure a request
is never added to the queuelist with a timeout_list not empty.
