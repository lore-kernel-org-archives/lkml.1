This is really a reflection of the whole problem with the OSD paradigm.

In theory, a filesystem on OSD is a thin layer of metadata mapping
objects to files.  Get this right and the storage will manage things,
like security and access and attributes (there's even a natural mapping
to the VFS concept of extended attributes).  Plus, the storage has
enough information to manage persistence, backups and replication.

The real problem is that no-one has actually managed to come up with a
useful VFS<->OSD mapping layer (even by extending or altering the VFS).
Every filesystem that currently uses OSD has a separate direct OSD
speaking interface (i.e. it slices out the block layer to do this and
talks directly to the storage).

I suppose this could be taken to show that such a layer is impossibly
complex, as you assert, but its lack is reflected in strange looking
design decisions like in-kernel mkfs.  It would also mean that there
would be very little layered code sharing between ODS based filesystems.

I don't like it mainly because it's not truly a useful general framework
for others to build on.  However, as argued above, there might not
actually be such a useful framework, so as long as the only two
consumers (you and Lustre) want an interface like this, I'll put it in.
