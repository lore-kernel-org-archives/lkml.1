You mean like hitting 'skip commercial' on the remote, and 2 minutes later
when the commercials are almost over, then it happens.  Yeah users get a
bit peeved at that.  Fortunately that particularly behaviour is somewhat
rare.  5 to 10 seconds is more common and sometimes it works fine.

I would have to get _very_ annoyed before that happened.  I would have
to find a less annoying OS to switch to as well.

Certainly my problems are likely to a large extent mythtv's fault.
