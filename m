It appears so, yes.

Not everyone has an Intel SSD. But yes, latency is definitely more
important than throughput. That's not the same as saying that throughput
doesn't matter, because it definitely does.

I haven't either. On monday I'll throw some testing and patches on the
boxes here. We can get the latency right, I want that as much as the
next guy. I just want to make sure it doesn't become too one-sided.

Unless you make all journal writes sync, ext3 fsync will always suck big
time. But I get your point.
