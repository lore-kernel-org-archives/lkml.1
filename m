Its a performance fix but also a correctness issue with multiple pid
namespaces. Here is the modified patch with the simplified changelog and
comment removed.

Not sure I fully understand this. A process, and by extension its 'struct
pid' is visible in multiple namespaces and we maintain this list of
namespaces in each 'struct pid'.

Are you suggesting having a pid_namespace with a list of all 'struct pids'
that are visible in it ?

| 
| Sukadev, could you cc me if you do that kind of changes?

Sure - I will.

Subject: [PATCH 3/5] Use task_pid() to find leader's pid

From: Sukadev Bhattiprolu <sukadev@us.ibm.com>

Use task_pid() to get leader's 'struct pid' and avoid the find_pid().
