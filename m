Ok, so how about doing something like this to reduce the
number of balances on large writes, but causing at least one
balance call for every write that occurs:

	int	nr = 0;
	.....
	while() {
		....
		if (!(nr % 256)) {
			/* do balance */
		}
		nr++;
		....
	}

That way you get a balance on the first page on every write,
but then hold off balancing on that write again for some
number of pages.

Hmmmm.  Reasonable theory. We used to do gigantic delalloc extents -
we paid no attention to congestion and could allocate and write
several GB at a time. Latency was an issue, though, so it got
changed to be bound by nr_to_write.

I guess we need to be issuing larger allocations. Can you remove
you patches and see what effect using the allocsize mount
option has on throughput? This changes the default delalloc EOF
preallocation size, which means more or less allocations. The
default is 64k and it can go as high as 1GB, IIRC.

Cheers,

Dave.
