Some questions among many I have:

1. Where and how TCM is better over the existing mainline target 
framework STGT to justify such a move as adding a new piece of code 
doing the same job?

2. On the linux-iscsi.org main page (BTW, the comparison on that page 
isn't fully correct about STGT and SCST) you claim that TCM is a generic 
target engine. But how can you prove (and test) that if there are no 
hardware target drivers for TCM?

Also patch 7 implements MIBs through procfs. Procfs is for long time 
forbidden for adding anything like that, so you can't push it in the 
mainline.
