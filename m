Thanks for the writeup.  It really helps and is most worthwhile for a

But that's only true if the thing is poorly implemented.

A high-level controller will need some view of the busyness of the
underlying device(s).  That could be "proportion of idle time", or
"average length of queue" or "average request latency" or some mix of
these or something else altogether.

But these things are simple to calculate, and are simple to feed back
to the higher-level controller and probably don't require any changes
to to IO scheduler at all, which is a great advantage.


And I must say that high-level throttling based upon feedback from
lower layers seems like a much better model to me than hacking away in
the IO scheduler layer.  Both from an implementation point of view and
from a "we can get it to work on things other than block devices" point
of view.

Do you refer to each reader within group1, or to all readers?  It would be
daft if each reader in group1 were to get 100ms.

And yet that is what you appear to mean.

But surely nobody would do that - the 100ms would be assigned to and
distributed amongst all readers in group1?

I don't understand why you're comparing this implementation with such
an obviously dumb competing design!

That's an administrator error, isn't it?  Should have put the
different-priority processes into different groups.

That sounds like a bug.

The IO schedulers already take care of read-vs-write and already take
care of preventing large writes-starve-reads latencies (or at least,
they're supposed to).

Why?

If it's a read, we just block the userspace process.

If it's a delayed write, the IO submission already happens in a kernel thread.

If it's a synchronous write, we have to block the userspace caller
anyway.

Async reads might be an issue, dunno.

But we already have that problem with delayed writeback, which is a
huge thing - often it's the majority of IO.

Well maybe, maybe not.  If a group is throttled, it isn't submitting
new IO.  The unthrottled group is doing the IO submitting and that IO
will have decent locality.

hm.  What will be the effects of this limitation in real-world use?

It depends on the size of the inter-group timeslices.  If the amount of
time for which a group is unthrottled is "large" comapred to the
typical anticipation times, this issue fades away.

And those timeslices _should_ be large.  Because as you mentioned
above, different groups are probably working different parts of the
disk.

That's a bit of a toy.

Do we have testing results for more enterprisey hardware?  Big storage
arrays?  SSD?  Infiniband?  iscsi?  nfs? (lol, gotcha)

Isn't that a CFQ shortcoming which we should address separately?  If
so, the comparisons aren't presently valid because we're comparing with
a CFQ which has known, should-be-fixed problems.

Here's where it all falls to pieces.

For async writeback we just don't care about IO priorities.  Because
from the point of view of the userspace task, the write was async!  It
occurred at memory bandwidth speed.

It's only when the kernel's dirty memory thresholds start to get
exceeded that we start to care about prioritisation.  And at that time,
all dirty memory (within a memcg?) is equal - a high-ioprio dirty page
consumes just as much memory as a low-ioprio dirty page.

So when balance_dirty_pages() hits, what do we want to do?

I suppose that all we can do is to block low-ioprio processes more
agressively at the VFS layer, to reduce the rate at which they're
dirtying memory so as to give high-ioprio processes more of the disk
bandwidth.

But you've gone and implemented all of this stuff at the io-controller
level and not at the VFS level so you're, umm, screwed.

Importantly screwed!  It's a very common workload pattern, and one
which causes tremendous amounts of IO to be generated very quickly,
traditionally causing bad latency effects all over the place.  And we
have no answer to this.
