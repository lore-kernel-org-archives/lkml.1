Actually, out of tree projects trying to make their way upstream are
welcome to use the various linux- mailing lists to solicit feedback and
review.  This method was, for instance, how FCoE made it in.

I've found that spamassassin does a good job of marking patches as non
spam.  Also, if you're using zmailer, vger seems to have some type of
patch recognition system built in which might be worth co-opting.
