IMHO, in those cases these SSD driver needs to hook into block layer's request
queue mechanism if they need io controlling mechanism instead of we coming
up a device mapper module.

Think of it that if somebody needs CFQ like tasks classes and prio
suported on these devices, should we also come up with another device
mapper module "dm-cfq"?

Jens, I am wondering if similiar concerns have popped in the past also for
CFQ also? Somebody asking to support task prio and classes on devices which
don't use standard IO scheduler?

Thanks
Vivek
