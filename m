We can't do block allocation in writepage because we can't handler
ENOSPC during writepage. So the patch attempt to make sure we do
all block allocation in the process context. For mmap we should
do it in page_mkwrite and for write in write_begin.

That is what is done in the patch i posted
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.ext4/13468

But that is not just enough. We also need to make sure we get a
page_fault when we try to write at another offset via mmap address so
that we can do block allocation via page_mkwrite. To do that all code
path that extend i_size should mark the page write protect.

__block_write_full_page already does that. It looks at the last_block
