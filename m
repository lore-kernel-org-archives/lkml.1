Yeah, that patch looks totally wrong.  It's not generally a good idea
to do a loop where the exit condition depends on something you don't
control.  And error values from filesystem methods are typically like
that.  For example with fuse, the error code could come from an
unprivileged userspace process.

I didn't realize this aspect of the bug previously, because I
concentrated on the lockd inconsistency.

Btw, why hasn't this work been posted on -fsdevel prior to merging
into mainline?

EAGAIN for a blocking lock is nonsensical, so my original patch could
still make sense.  But that's no longer a regression, and not all that
important.
