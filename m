Nicholas,

In the previous iteration of this patchset I asked you some essential 
questions about what advantages TCM has over STGT which can't be 
implemented in STGT and can justify the move from it to TCM, as well as 
how did you test TCM to claim that TCM is generic and, hence, can work 
with hardware target adapters (http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/9/15/315). 
There was no reply answering those questions, instead you keep pushing 
your patches. (In fact, I received privately even 2 very emotional and 
offensive replies from Nicholas Bellinger.)

So, since there is no reply, I didn't miss anything and there are no 
points to justify the move from STGT to TCM, and TCM is "generic" only 
for software iSCSI targets.

For sake of completeness, I should also mention that the move from STGT 
to TCM is not a move forward, it's a move backward, because TCM doesn't 
allow creation of backend and target drivers in user space.

Hopefully, somebody more authoritative than I will ask you to stop 
pushing your patches until you address the above questions.

Vlad
