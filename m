If the filesystem becomes out of space and we have over-committed these
dirty mmapped blocks, then we most definitely want to keep them around.
An error of the system losing a few pages (or if it happens an insanely
large number of times, then slowly dying due to memory leak) is better
than an app suddenly seeing the contents of the page change to nulls
under it when the kernel decides to do some page reclaim.

And this is a valid warning because we don't know that all buffers are
uptodate or which ones to set as dirty, I think. Unless it is impossible
to have dirty && !uptodate pages come thought this path.

But you shouldn't need to redirty the page at all if we change
block_write_full_page in the way I suggested. Because then it won't
have cleaned the buffer, and it will have done redirty_page_for_writepage.

Well the core page_mkwrite function doesn't care about that case
properly either (it just doesn't allocate buffers on extend). I agree it
should be fixed, but it is a little hard (I need to fix it in fsblock
and I think what is required is a setattr helper for that).
