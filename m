Sure there are compat issues, just like there are compat issues with the 
existing consensus goal of moving libata to the block layer -- part of 
which implies that ATA disks would be served via a "native" block device 
rather than drivers/scsi/sd.c.

So at least to me, it is axiomatic that these issues will be examined.

As to benefits, the phrase "more natural" means the code naturally 
aligns with existing object topologies (ata_host becomes analagous to 
Scsi_Host), which always has a long list of technical benefits.

- we get to remove all the ugly hacks currently in place that assume 
ata_port is _the_ first class object.
- we get to remove all the workarounds where SCSI assumes it manipulates 
all devices on a controller (not true in current libata)
- SCSI (soon block) host-wide busy, block etc functionality now works as 
expected
- it makes the libata conversion from SCSI to block layer easier
- it makes integration with SAS+SATA devices such as mvsas or ipr easier
- the list goes on; that is just off the top of my head, before my 
morning Mountain Dew

"more natural" also solves a longstanding user confusion/complaint about 
libata:  users expected that libata would export each ATA "channel" 
(bus) as a SCSI channel.

Are you aware that EH is already receiving a stream of updates, moving 
it from SCSI to the block layer?  This area has been in constant motion 
since, well, Tejun arrived and started improving things!  :)
