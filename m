nit:  I'd use priv_ rather than lpm_, just as we use security_ rather
than lsm_.

Do you plan to pass other arguments to the privilege hook call, like the
object?  If not, then there is no point in changing the capable call
sites at all - just change its implementation to invoke a priv_capable()
hook instead of a security_capable() hook.

Changing all of the call sites seems a bit prohibitive for an initial
implementation; rewiring the internals of capable() to use a new
privilege hook interface would be a lot simpler.

You also have to migrate the other security hooks presently used to
support capabilities to your privilege framework.
