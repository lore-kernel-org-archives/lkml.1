I'm planning on sending them off to Linus for 2.6.28 this week,
assuming nobody can think of a plausible reason to not do that.

Now I didn't look _very_ closely at the chronology, but I think that
revert-percpu-counter-clean-up-percpu_counter_sum_and_set.patch reverts
a post-2.6.27 change, and is not needed in stable.

revert-percpu_counter-new-function-percpu_counter_sum_and_set.patch
however reverts a pre-2.6.27 change, and should be merged into 2.6.27. 
This patch reverts the addition and use of
percpu_counter_sum_and_set(), which is racy and can corrupt the
counters.

However
revert-percpu_counter-new-function-percpu_counter_sum_and_set.patch
won't apply to 2.6.27 because the dirty_blocks stuff was added and
generates rejects.

So if all the above is correct, I'd propose that if and when
revert-percpu_counter-new-function-percpu_counter_sum_and_set.patch
hits mainline, we should ask the -stable guys to directly revert 

    commit e8ced39d5e8911c662d4d69a342b9d053eaaac4e

        percpu_counter: new function percpu_counter_sum_and_set

which should be all that 2.6.27.x needs.

Agree?  If so, can you please take care of getting that patch over to
stable@kernel.org?  (I added the cc:stable to the diff, so there's
probably nothing which you need to do..)
