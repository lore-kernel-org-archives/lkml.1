I would't like to add many different interfaces to do the same thing.
I'd prefer to choose just one interface and always use it. We just have
to define which is the best one. IMHO dirty_bytes is more generic. If
we want to define the limit as a % we can always do that in userspace.

Right, but I'd prefer to start with a simple solution. Handling this
per-page is too costly and not good for entire I/O for now. We can
always improve service differentiation and fairness in a second
step, I think.

Yes, if we want to take care ot that, at least we could start with a
per-inode solution. It will probably introduce less overhead and will
work the the most part of the cases (except the case when multiple
cgroups write to the same file/inode).
