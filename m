This bug report is the result of code inspection. I'm considering functions 
which can call might_sleep macro and consequently which can not be called from 
atomic context. 
I choose function scsi_device_put. There are two paths to might_sleep macro. 
First path was shown in the report, second is:
1. scsi_device_put calls put_device at ./drivers/scsi/scsi.c:1111 
2. put_device calls kobject_put at ./drivers/base/core.c:1038 
3. kobject_put calls kref_put at ./lib/kobject.c
4. kref_put may call callback function kobject_release at ./lib/kref.c if 
refcount becomes zero
5. kobject_cleanup calls kobject_del at ./lib/kobject.c:562
6. kobject_del calls sysfs_remove_dir at ./lib/kobject.c:516
7. sysfs_remove_dir calls __sysfs_remove_dir at ./fs/sysfs/dir.c:821
8. __sysfs_remove_dir calls sysfs_addrm_start at ./fs/sysfs/dir.c:789
9. sysfs_addrm_start calls mutex_lock at ./fs/sysfs/dir.c:377, which 
might_sleep because it calls might_sleep macro.

As you wrote earlier, scsi_device_put was designed with the ability to call 
last put from interrupt context, but as we can see from the paths there might 
be situations where it is not true. Moreover, while analysing different usage 
patterns of scsi_device_put, I found that people are using scsi_device_put as 
if it can not be called from atomic context. Because before calling 
scsi_device_put, spin_locks are always released (i.e. spin_unlock is called 
before scsi_device_put and spin_lock is called after it). Examples are:
1. drivers/scsi/dpt_i2o.c line 701
2. drivers/ata/libata-scsi.c line 3626
3. drivers/scsi/ipr.c line 2415

In scsi_lib.c  prior to scsi_device_put we always do scsi_device_get.  As far 
as I understand, if we are sure that scsi_device_put is always not last, then 
we can remove both calls to scsi_device_get and to scsi_device_put from the 
code without introducing races.

 347         list_for_each_entry_safe(sdev, tmp, &starget->devices,
 348                         same_target_siblings) {
 349                 if (sdev == current_sdev)
 350                         continue;
 351                 if (scsi_device_get(sdev))
 352                         continue;
 353
 354                 spin_unlock_irqrestore(shost->host_lock, flags);
 355                 blk_run_queue(sdev->request_queue);
 356                 spin_lock_irqsave(shost->host_lock, flags);
 357
 358                 scsi_device_put(sdev);
 359         }
