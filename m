Ok, that makes sense. Yes, adding a new pointer to the rpc_task doesn't
sound too costly. The hard part is getting this pointer from the higher
layers that would interpret this info to the correct RPC functions that
could populate it.

I don't really have a good feel for how we'd populate this new pointer
as well. For instance, you'd want to hang a mismatch_info struct on it 
for the case of RPC_PROG_MISMATCH, but in the case I was trying to fix
above, we'd just want a simple 32-bit error code. How will the RPC
engine know what this pointer points to? Or should we just make it a
new struct that has fields for each possibility?
