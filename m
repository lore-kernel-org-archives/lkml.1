Per-fs.

I don't think so.

Well, even remount-ro may be too late, IIRC.

Its "some" ... due to wear leveling logic.

Well, flashes do remap, so it is actually "random blocks".

This is not about barriers (that should be different topic). Atomic
write means that either whole sector is written, or nothing at all is
written. Because raid5 needs to update both master data and parity at
the same time, I don't think it can guarantee this during powerfail.

This document is about ext2. Ext3 can support barriers in
2.6.28. Someone else needs to write ext4 docs :-).

Sounds like broken disk, then. We should blacklist those.
