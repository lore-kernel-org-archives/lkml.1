I think you are right. We just need to be little careful while freeing
the request that associated request list might have gone away (rq->rl).

Or we probably can think of getting rid of (rq->rl) also and while
freeing request determine io queue and group from rq->ioq. But somehow
I remember that I had to introduce rq->rl otherwise I was running into
issues of request being mapped to different groups at different point
of time hence different request list etc. Will check again..

Looks like this is also doable. Good idea. Can't think of why can't
we get rid of rq->iog and manage with rq->ioq. There are only 1-2
places where ioq is not setup yet and rq has been mapped to the group.
There we shall have to carry group information or carry bio information
and map it again to get group info.

Will try to implement it and see how does it go.

Thanks
Vivek
