My point is that dm-ioband can be updated for improvements and
bug-fixing without stopping the system.

As I wrote in another email, I would like to make use of dm-ioband on
the system which doesn't support cgroup such as RHEL. In addition,
there are devices which doesn't use standard IO schedulers, and
dm-ioband can work on even such devices.

Thanks,
