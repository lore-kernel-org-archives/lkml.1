Adds ability to move all threads in a process to a new cgroup atomically

This patch adds functionality that enables users to move all threads in a
threadgroup at once to a cgroup by writing the tgid to the 'cgroup.procs'
file. This current implementation makes use of a per-threadgroup rwsem that's
taken for reading in the fork() path to prevent newly forking threads within
the threadgroup from "escaping" while the move is in progress.

Cgroups subsystems that need to perform per-thread actions in their
"attach" callback are (currently) responsible for doing their own
synchronization, since this occurs outside of the critical section
that locks against cloning within a thread group.
