In earlier versions of kmemleak, a block required two successive
classifications as leak before being reported. Maybe I should go back to
this approach.

The ext4 leak is real and a patch was proposed here:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/7/15/62

It seems that this patch hasn't been merged into mainline yet (in the
