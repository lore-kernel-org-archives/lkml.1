Spot on Rik, if every transition becomes a hypercall (and a synchronous
one at that), it isn't workable for us.  If, on the other hand, you
share the state bits between the guest and hypervisor, you need a giant
(standalone) bit array for per-page state, which is neither convenient
for Linux nor the hypervisor.  I believe s390 has an 'instruction' to
migrate the state bits into the hypervisor per-physical-page data
without requiring a hypercall.
