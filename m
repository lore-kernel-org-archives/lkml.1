No not quite. We use clock->xtime_nsec to store the high precision
xtime.tv_nsec. Its use is as follows:

1) We initialize it to xtime.tv_nsec << clock->shift
2) We accumulate into it
3) We tweak it as needed from clocksource_adjust()
4) We then store its value shifted back down and rounded up into
xtiem.tv_nsec.
5) We calculate the the difference between the rounded up value and
xtime_nsec, and add it to the error.

I'm still a little baffled, but I figure I can try to reproduce this
myself. So I'm working setting up hercules environment here to see if I
can't trigger it. Any help with config or links to your environment
would be great.

thanks
