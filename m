I've spent a bunch of time on this one, and noticed earlier today that I
still had bits of CONFIG_FTRACE compiling.  I wasn't actually tracing
anything, but it seems to have had a big performance hit.

The bad news is the simple spin got much much faster, dbench 50 coming
in at 1282MB/s instead of 580MB/s.  (other benchmarks give similar
results)

v10 is better that not spinning, but its in the 5-10% range.  So, I've
been trying to find ways to close the gap, just to understand exactly
where it is different.

If I take out:
	/*
	 * If there are pending waiters, join them.
	 */
	if (!list_empty(&lock->wait_list))
		break;


v10 pops dbench 50 up to 1800MB/s.  The other tests soundly beat my
spinning and aren't less fair.  But clearly this isn't a good solution.

I tried a few variations, like only checking the wait list once before
looping, which helps some.  Are there other suggestions on better tuning
options?

(I retested v7 and see similar results)
