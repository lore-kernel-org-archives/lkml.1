Let's decide how we _should_ do it, implement that, then teach cciss about
it, then try to ensure that new code uses the approved interfaces.  Over
time, people may (or may not) migrate existing code over to the new
interfaces.

They may also merge new code which uses open-coded hand-rolled stuff, too :(

Lots and lots and lots of systems don't have any disks larger than 2TB.

CONFIG_LBD=y gives us an additional 3kb of instructions on i386
allnoconfig.  Other architectures might do less well.  It's not a huge
difference, but that's the way in which creeping bloatiness happens.
