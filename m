Now, not so good :)

This is on 2.6.22-rc5

So I hibernated last night and resumed this morning.
Before hibernating I froze and sync'ed. After resume I thawed it. (Sorry Dave)

Here are some photos of the screen during resume. This is not 100% reproducable 
- it seems to occur only if the system is shutdown for 30mins or so.

Tejun, I wonder if error handling during resume is problematic? I got the same 
errors in 2.6.21. I have never seen these (or any other libata) errors other 
than during resume.

(hard to read, here's one from 2.6.21
http://www.dgreaves.com/pub/2.6.21-resume-failure.jpg

I _think_ I've only seen the xfs problem when a resume shows these errors.


Ok, to try and cause a problem I ran a make and got this back at once:
make: stat: Makefile: Input/output error
make: stat: clean: Input/output error
make: *** No rule to make target `clean'.  Stop.
make: stat: GNUmakefile: Input/output error
make: stat: makefile: Input/output error


I caught the first dmesg this time:

Filesystem "dm-0": Corruption of in-memory data detected.  Shutting down

Please umount the filesystem, and rectify the problem(s)

so I cd'ed out of /scratch and umounted.

I then tried the xfs_check.

haze:~# xfs_check /dev/video_vg/video_lv
ERROR: The filesystem has valuable metadata changes in a log which needs to
be replayed.  Mount the filesystem to replay the log, and unmount it before
re-running xfs_check.  If you are unable to mount the filesystem, then use
the xfs_repair -L option to destroy the log and attempt a repair.
Note that destroying the log may cause corruption -- please attempt a mount
of the filesystem before doing this.

haze:~# umount /scratch/

ugh. Try again
haze:~# xfs_check /dev/video_vg/video_lv
haze:~#

whilst running a top reported this as roughly the peak memory usage:
  8759 root      18   0  479m 474m  876 R  2.0 46.9   0:02.49 xfs_db
so it looks like it didn't run out of memory (machine has 1Gb).

Dave, I ran xfs_check -v... but I got bored when it reached 122M of bz2 
compressed output with no sign of stopping... still got it if it's any use...

lots of:
setting block 0/0 to sb
setting block 0/1 to freelist
setting block 0/2 to freelist
setting block 0/3 to freelist
setting block 0/4 to freelist
setting block 0/75 to btbno
setting block 0/346901 to free1
setting block 0/346903 to free1
setting block 0/346904 to free1
setting block 0/346905 to free1
   and stuff like this
inode 128 mode 040777 fmt extents afmt extents nex 1 anex 0 nblk 1 sz 4096
inode 128 nlink 39 is dir
inode 128 extent [0,7,1,0]

I then rebooted and ran a repair which didn't show any damage.

David
