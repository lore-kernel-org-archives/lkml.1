Yes, this is the case. Using breakpoints for markers quickly becomes
noticeable for thing such as scheduler instrumentation, page fault
handler instrumentation, etc. And yes, I have developed kernel tracer,
LTTng, which takes care of writing the data to trace buffers
efficiently. The last time I took performance measurements, it was
performing locking and writing to the memory buffer in about 270ns on a
3GHz Pentium 4. It might be a tiny bit slower now that it parses the
markers format strings dynamically, but nothing very significant.

But there is another point that markers do which the breakpoint won't
give you : they extract local variables from functions and they identify
them with field names which separates the instrumentation from the
actual kernel implementation details. In order to do that, I rely on gcc
building a stack frame for a function call, which I don't want to build
unnecessarity when the marker is disabled. This is why I use a jump to
skip passing the arguments on the stack and the function call.
