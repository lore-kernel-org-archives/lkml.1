Do you mean kfree(root) should be called after kill_litter_super()?
I don't see the point here..

We are right, dentry-> but not cgrp->dentry-> should be used.

The code was inherited from cpuset. I doubted it's redundant, but
I was not confident enough to remove it.

cgroup_path() was inherited from cpuset's cpuset_path(), and I think it's
true it races with rename.
