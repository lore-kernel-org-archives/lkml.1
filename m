Only if you can dirty them and flush them to disk while the direct
read is waiting in the I/O queue (remember, the direct read flushes
dirty cached data before being issued). Given that we don't lock the
inode in the buffered I/O *writeback* path, we have to stop pages being
dirtied in the page cache up front so we don't have mmap writeback
over the top of the direct read.

Hence we have to prevent mmap for dirtying the same file offset we
are doing direct reads on until the direct read has been issued.

i.e. we need a barrier.

No, but the data _in memory_ will, and now when the direct read
completes it will data that is different to what is in the page
cache. For direct I/O we define the correct data to be what is on
disk, not what is in memory, so any time we bypass what is in
memory, we need to ensure that we prevent the data being changed
again in memory before we issue the disk I/O.

In theory, yes.

In practice, if you don't invalidate the page cache you have no
mechanism of synchronising mmap with direct I/O, and at that
point you have no coherency model that you can work with in
your filesystem. You have to be able to guarantee synchronisation
betwen the different methods that can dirty data before you
can give any guarantees about data coherency.....

Dave.
