Well, for us it would be even worse since now we'll have to do casting
to __beX just to shut sparse up, which makes the code even more
unreadable.

I really don't think so.  The current:

cmd[2] = X >> 24;
cmd[3] = X >> 16;
...

make sense to a storage person because they replicate exactly how the
standards are laid out.  They're also clearer than the plethora of
unaligned_write_be32 etc.

The only real one we need an accessor for is 64 bits ... purely because
most people are too lazy to write all eight statements.

The optimisation argument is a bit of a myth ... the number of cycles
taken by these stores is dwarfed by the rest of the code path, even if
the compiler totally screws up the optimisation, which, realistically,
it shouldn't since it should know the platform native endianness in most
cases.

There was a fairly luke warm response to the idea of SCSI accessors
basically showing the level of apathy; certainly generic ones would be a
shade worse than this because now readers have to work out what they're
doing.  In general, I'd prefer the SCSI stack just be left alone rather
than converted to accessors like this.
