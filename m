Yeap, that we can do.

How so?  sysfs_sb->bitmap which contains enough bits for all the defined
tags and determining whether a sd should be shown or not is as simple as
single test_bit.

What I'm feeling unease about is the extra level of abstraction added by
tag types.  A sd is given a tag.  A sb shows a set of tags.  The most
straight forward to implement that is to give sd a tag and test the tag
against sb's set of tags.  The type is added because pointer tag
requires sequential matching which is usually best to avoid.  It's
nothing fundamental.  It's an extra baggage.

The thing is that I don't really see why there's tagged_dir_ops at all.
 What's needed is tagged sd's and sb's which can show subset of those
tags, so adding callback ops for tags just doesn't make much sense to
me.  The interface should ideally be...

1. alloc/release tag
2. set / change / remove tag on sd
3. enable / disable tag on a sb

This has been my opinion from the beginning.  Unless the tags need to be
changed dynamically on demand (which I hope is not the case), there just
is plainly no reason to have callbacks for tags.

Thanks.
