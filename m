You mounted without quotas in the middle step, thereby invalidating
them.

Log recovery occurs on read only mounts. Log recovery on filesystems without
quota enabled ignores quota changes in the log (as quotas are not enabled
and hence we can't assume that there's dquots still on disk). Hence a
mount read only without quota enabled will leave quota inconsistent on disk.

i.e

> 	mount -o usrquota,grpquota /dev/mapper/myxfs /mnt
> 	umount /mnt
> 	mount -o ro /dev/mapper/myxfs /mnt

Quota is now potentially inconsistent, and hence:

> 	umount /mnt
> 	mount -o usrquota,grpquota /dev/mapper/myxfs /mnt

This mount *must* recalculate it. So, behaviour is as expected
given the above command sequence.

You should use this as the middle step:

	mount -o ro,usrquota,grpquota /dev/mapper/myxfs /mnt

So that log replay replays all the journalled quota changes so
that the quota remains consistent with the rest of the filesystem.
Then you wont see a recalc when you remount rw.

Cheers,

Dave.
