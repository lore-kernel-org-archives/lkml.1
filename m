No, not ext3 on SATA disk with barriers on and proper use of
fsync(). I actually tested that.

Yes, I should be able to hotunplug SATA drives and expect the data
that was fsync-ed to be there.

I know I will lose data. Both ext2 and ext3 will lose data on
flashdisk. (That's what I'm trying to document). But... what is the
benefit of ext3 journaling on MD RAID5? (On flash, ext3 at least
protects you against kernel panic. MD RAID5 is in software, so... that
additional protection is just not there).

Perhaps noone told them MD RAID5 is dangerous? You see, that's exactly
what I'm trying to document here.
