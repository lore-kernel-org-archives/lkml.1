For supporting io controller mechanism in older kernels which don't have
cgroup interface support, I think one needs to maintain out of the tree
module. Upstream does not benefit from it.

This is a interesting use case. Few thoughts.

- Can't io scheduling mechanism of these devices make use of elevator and
  elevator fair queuing interfaces to take advantage of io controlling
  mechanism. It should not be too difficult. Look at noop. It has
  just 131 lines of code and it now supports hierarchical io scheduling.
 
  This will come with request queue and its merging and plug/unplug
  mechanism. Is that an issue?

- If not, then yes, for these corner cases, io scheduler based controller
  does not work as it is.

Thanks
