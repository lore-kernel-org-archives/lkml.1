Dunno and it isn't really my concern... I'm interested in HPC jobs that
can collaborate with the C/R feature. For examples, those jobs that use
interconnect hardware that will never be *checkpointable*... Usually,
the batch manager tells the jobs it's going to be checkpointed, so that
it can disconnect/shrink memory/reach quiescent point, and reconnect
after resuming execution.

I understand you aim at supporting transparent C/R of connected TCP
sockets. Nice feature. Could you give use cases where it's *really*
helpful/needed/mandatory ?
