ext4_mb_mark_diskspace_used use ac->ac_b_ex.fe_len which is NOT the normalized
request len. it is min(allocated_len, original_len). So i guess that code
should be safe

That would imply the file system was full. But the dumpe2fs ouput list
large number of free blocks. But yes the code should have released the
quota reservation before trying block reservation again.
