You are right, this is a bug.

Currently, we only support one session per  nfs_client -  one session  
for all partition mounts to the same NFS server.
For NFSv4.1 the per partition struct nfs_server rsize/wsize is used to  
construct rpc requests that are sent over the session so the rsize/ 
wsize must not be larger than the session max_resp_sz/max_rqst_sz.

nfs4_init_session should simply return if the nfs_client cl_cons_state  
is not NFS_CS_SESSION_INITING.
I shouldn't be trying to set the session max_resp_sz/max_rqst_sz to  
the rsize/wsize, but rather to the maximum rsize/wsize supported by  
the client.
If the server accepts or increases the max_resp_sz/max_rqst_sz then  
all is well.
If the server reduces the max_resp_sz/max_rqst_sz, the maximum rsize/ 
wsize available for NFSv4.1 partition mounts to the server needs to be  
reduced accordingly. So the nfs_server rsize/wsize needs to be bound  
by the session max_resp_sz/max_rqst_sz as well as by the maximum  
supported size.

If you think this is correct, I'll send a patch.
