James,
      I am facing issues with device removal being done when there
are commands outstanding in the LLD. As explained in my original post,
its resulting in effects ranging from the duplicate kobject warnings to
the inability of the scsi subsystem to find a valid device (all symptoms
are related to the fact that two scsi devices with the same HBTL but in 
diff states, SDEV_DEL and SDEV_RUNNING, are in the lists).
      After extensive audit of the code I'm quite certain that the aforementioned
patch is the right thing to do. I'll greatly appreciate if you can highlight
reason(s) why that might not be a good idea. Pls apply o/w.

Thanx,
Tomar
