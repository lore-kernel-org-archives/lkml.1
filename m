I'm mostly worried about delayed allocation case. My impression was that
holding number of pages locked isn't a good idea, even if they're locked
in index order. so, I was going to turn number of pages writeback, then
allocate blocks for all of them at once, then put proper blocknr's into
bh's (or PG_mappedtodisk?).

nope, I mean sb->inode->page walk.

if I'm right holding number of pages locked, then they won't be locked, but
writeback. of course kjournald can block on writeback as well, but how does
it find pages with *newly allocated* blocks only?

not dirty inodes only, but rather some fast way to find pages with newly
allocated pages.

indeed. this is a root cause of all this complexity.

thanks, Alex
