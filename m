Put them at the top then with an additional ifndef.

It _is_ about include dependencies.

If you think that I'm ignoring your argument, then screw you.

I'm making a counter argument which I believe is _equally_ valid and which
I believe is actually far more important - at least it is _to_ _me_.

I don't wish to see my build times extended any more than they already
have been by sloppy and lazy programming in the kernel.  And if I didn't
make that point earlier, what a shame.  I'm making it NOW.

I've been trying over the last six months to (a) reduce the number of
files included in the ARM sub-tree and (b) reduce the namespace pollution
from ARM headers into the generic kernel both with the aim of trying to
improve build time.  That's something you can verify by looking through
the commits in arch/arm/include/asm if you think I'm making this up,
which clearly you will do.

Oh why bring it up after 11 replies.  I guess I'm just useless at
expressing myself clearly.
