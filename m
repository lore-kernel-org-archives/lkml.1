I prefer a global variable over duplicate code and stuff which I have
to find out from random places.

show_interrupts is arch specific. timers are not.

You can't do a real snapshot of the timer wheel. All you can do is
walk it carefully and make a copy of the timer_list structure and then
print it. The timer wheel can be pretty full and we definitely do not
want to stop a CPU fully just to print debug information.

We want a consistent format for all the printouts.
