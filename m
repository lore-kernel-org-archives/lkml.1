Trying to apply this, but it fails from patch #24 and on:

patching file block/ll_rw_blk.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 3852 (offset 49 lines).
Hunk #2 succeeded at 3867 with fuzz 2 (offset 49 lines).
Hunk #3 succeeded at 3904 with fuzz 1 (offset 66 lines).
Hunk #4 FAILED at 3916.
Hunk #5 succeeded at 3967 with fuzz 2 (offset 60 lines).
1 out of 5 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file block/ll_rw_blk.c.rej
patching file include/linux/blkdev.h
Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!  Assume -R? [n] 

This is 2.6.24-rc5 (pretty close to at least, no changes to ll_rw_blk.c
from that version). Are you using quilt and forgot to refresh, or
something like that?
