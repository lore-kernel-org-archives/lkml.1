This message is shared with the check_disk_change() routine. Yes, it is
scary, but perhaps that is to the good. We have no guarantee how the
user changed the underlying storage.  For example, they might have
shrunk the volume below the size of an underlying file-system and then
grew it again before kicking off the resize detection (admittedly a
degenerate case), in which case the warning is appropriate.  Any
suggestions on better wording?
