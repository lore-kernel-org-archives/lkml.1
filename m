I wouldn't say "right amount", more of "traditional amount".  If you have super
slow storage this patch will not result in you waiting any longer than you did
originally, which I think is what the concern was, that we not wait a super long
time just because the disk is slow.

This stat gathering process has been very unscientific :), I just ran once and
took that number.  Sometimes the patched version would come out on top,
sometimes it wouldn't.  If I were to do this the way my stat teacher taught me
I'm sure the patched/unpatched versions would come out to be relatively the same
in the 2 thread case.

Yes I will be doing a jbd2 version of this patch provided there are no issues
with this patch.  Thanks much for the comments,
