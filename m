Yeah, that is what pure MCS locks do -- however I don't think its a
feasible strategy for this spin/sleep hybrid.

That's not going to fly I think. Lockdep does this but its very
expensive and has some issues. We're currently at 48 max owners, and
still some code paths manage to exceed that.

Which is O(n).

Spinlocks can use 'pure' MCS locks.
