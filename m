Don't be silly ... abstractions are the core of how we program something
as complex as platform hardware.  By design, abstractions hide
information.  Good abstractions hide information you don't need to know.
Take the DMA API for instance: dma_map_sg() hides all of the platform
specifics of whether or not you have an IOMMU and how it is programmed.
That's a good abstraction ... drivers would be a complete mess if they
had to do it themselves.

Really, I don't buy this at all.  The first thing you complained about
when you came up with sg_ring was how painful it was to update the 30
odd SCSI drivers.  That was also my reaction when the scatterlist
chaining idea came along.  My second was supposing this isn't quite
right and we modify the way chaining is done ... do I have to update all
the drivers all over again?  Hence one of the input requirements to the
update was a consumer abstraction to insulate drivers from the
implementation.

Thinking about information that the drivers don't need to know, the
obvious thing is how the actual scatterlist is implemented, whether its
a list based ring, a pointer/mark based chain or an as yet to be
invented annulus.  All I think most consumers need is:

     1. A way to get the first scatterlist element
     2. A way to get the next scatterlist element
     3. An iterator over the entire scatterlist
     4. A way to tell if they've reached the last scatterlist element.

Actually 1,2,4 satisfy 3 but it's such a common operation in most
drivers that it was a good simplification.  Other things are sizing and
element count.

sg_chain isn't part of the consumer interface it's part of the
producer/manipulator interface.  I care a lot less about getting that
one right first time because it only occurs in one place in the SCSI
mid-layer and is easy to update and fix.

My principal concern at the moment is the consumer interface ... if
there's a fault in that we need to know now.

No, the kernel ABI is about preserving binary semantics for proprietary
drivers.  We're talking about an API here which is a totally different
thing.  I don't believe I said anywhere that it should be a fixed API
for all time ... that would also be silly.  However, that doesn't mean
you don't take the best care you can to get an API as right as you can.
If it's wrong, it will be altered, but it is much nicer to get it right
first time so it doesn't have to be.
