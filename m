In FTL case, damaged sectors are not neccessarily adjacent. Otherwise
this looks okay and fair to me.

Ok, would you be against adding:

"Running non-journalled filesystem on these may be desirable, as
journalling can not provide meaningful protection, anyway."

Yes, it applies to all journalling filesystems; it is just that I was 
clever/paranoid enough to avoid anything non-ext3.

ext3 docs still says:
# The journal supports the transactions start and stop, and in case of a
# crash, the journal can replay the transactions to quickly put the
# partition back into a consistent state.

Ok, works for me.

Document that many devices are too broken for filesystems to protect
data in case of powerfail.
