Different to your approach of trying to achieve the same with one huge 
help text I see a realistic chance of it working.

What's other alternatives do we have?

Automatically select BLK_DEV_SD and BLK_DEV_SR if one driver that uses 
the SCSI layer gets enabled by the user?

This is a debug option and it's unlikely that users will need it unless 
someone explicitely requested them to do so, so it's not such an 
important issue.

If SBP-2 is what you get in a shop when asking for an external
Firewire disk enclosure then it's not sold as SCSI.
