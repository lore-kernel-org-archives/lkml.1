We should fix this in 2.6.28 - right now percpu_counter_sum() is subtly
corrupting the counter's value.

I sent two revert patches which I hope to merge into 2.6.28.  Could you
guys please read/review/maybe-test them?

They will make ext4 as slow as it was in 2.6.26, but presumably that's
not a catastrophe.

We can do lots of things in 2.6.29.  Including just making ->counters
an array of atomic_t.
