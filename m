block_write_full_page will have been called after a
clear_page_dirty_for_io() call, so it should not be dirty.

I guess it could have been dirtied again as you don't need the page
lock to dirty a page... though if it is beyond EOF, maybe you do...

Hmm, I have a very strong feeling that "this cannot happen", and that
it should certainly be "this shouldn't happen", but I guess I'm not
100% convincing at the moment :-)

I get the problem now.. I read the 'mmap' man page:

       A file is mapped in multiples of the page size.  For a file that is not
       a multiple of the page  size,  the  remaining  memory  is  zeroed  when
       mapped, and writes to that region are not written out to the file.  The
       effect of changing the size of the underlying file of a mapping on  the
       pages  that  correspond  to  added  or  removed  regions of the file is
       unspecified.

As the situation you are describing is documented as having
"unspecified" behaviour, I guess you can do whatever you want.
So just not writing out to any block that isn't backed by a filesystem
block would be defensible.  But maybe not desirable.

I like your idea of playing with the mapping.
I don't think you want to bother mapping it as "read-only" - just
unmap it altogether.  When it is next mapped writable to service a
write you will get a page_mkwrite call and you can fix things up.

To unmap the page, just call
  unmap_mapping_range(mapping, page_index << PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT,
		      PAGE_CACHE_SIZE, 0);
(I got that from truncate_inode_pages_range in mm/truncate.c).
You can do this while you have the page locked, and it won't be
mapped again until you unlock it.
