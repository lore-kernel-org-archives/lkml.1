Actually, I've been keeping an eye on that

So, since their respective names are on the proposals, it's no real
secret that EMC are pushing WRITE_SAME and Netapp UNMAP, but they are
both working together on this.  I've already communicated to T10 via
intermediaries that we'd like only a single implementation for this,
please.  However, failing that, the current situation where we know from
an inquiry that the array supports thin provisioning, but don't know
whether it supports WRITE_SAME or UNMAP until we get a command failure
is unacceptable.

If we could get some good solid implementation evidence that WRITE_SAME
is much easier for an OS than UNMAP, that might help with the T10
deliberations.

Me neither.  I'm sort of OK with a transformed operation, callout for
the ULD, but I really don't see why a disk only function should go
through the host template.

So the last ATA data set management with TRIM proposal I saw had a set
of discontiguous ranges, very like UNMAP.  It's certainly possible to do
the transformation, you just have to drop the sector buffer and add one
for the ranges (then reverse it in the back translation for the
completion) but it's not pretty.
