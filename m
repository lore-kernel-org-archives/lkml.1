If you don't mind trashing some more ext3 root filesystems :-) you can
try this patch.  It's almost certainly not quite the right thing to do
and I have probably messed up the target's reference counting, but
maybe it's a step in the right direction.

This strange business of deferring unregistration into a workqueue 
means that the calls might not be executed in the same order that 
they're made.
