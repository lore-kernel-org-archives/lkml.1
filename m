I think you misunderstood.  Buses are enumerated before this code is
reached and thus initdev_found() has already been called for all attached
block devices. If there are devices found, but not probed, the number
of pending BLOCK device initdevs will be greater than zero.

Also, this code doesn't depend on rootdelay at all. In fact, avoiding
unnecessary delays both in finding devices and in finding out that you don't
have a device is the whole reason for this patch. I really can't stand
things like rootdelay so long as the hardware supports proper device
discovery.

If this were to happen, then you would be correct, but since initdev_found()
is called for all block devices before reaching this code, you will only
continue once initdev_probe_done() has been called for all of those devices.

I'm less confident in the block code than the console and networking parts, but
don't think there is a problem with any of these.  It's also worth mentioning
that this is not a theoretical exercise--without this patch, I have no USB
console, network device, or root filesystem. With the patch, I have all three.
That is no guarantee of correctness, but it implies that it's on the right
path.

I would appreciate it if you could take a closer look at the locations where
initdev_found() and initdev_probe_done() are called and see if you still
think there is a problem.
