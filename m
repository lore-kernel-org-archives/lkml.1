Benchmarks comparing what ?

It is a standard that KVM and lguest are using. I don't think it needs
any benchamrks to show if a particular approach is faster or not. 
VMware has supported paravirtualized devices in backend for more than an
year now (may be more, don't quote me on this), and the backend is
common across different guest OS's. Virtual hardware emulation helps us
give a common interface to different GOS's, whereas virtio binds this
heavily to Linux usage. And please note that the backend implementation
for our virtual device was done before virtio was integrated in
mainline.

Also, from your statements above it seems that you think we are
proposing to change the standard communication mechanism (between guest
& hypervisor) for Linux. For the record that's not the case, the
standard that the Linux based VM's are using does not need to be
changed. This pvscsi driver is used for a new SCSI HBA, how does it
matter if this SCSI HBA is actually a virtual HBA and implemented by the
hypervisor in software.

Yes it is, but the backend is as good as written in stone, as it is
being supported by our various products which are out in the market. The
pvscsi driver that I proposed for mainlining has also been in existence
for some time now and was being used/tested heavily. Earlier we used to
distribute it as part of our open-vm-tools project, and it is now that
we are proposing to integrate it with mainline.

So if you are hinting that since the backend is software, it can be
changed the answer is no. The reason being, their are existing
implementations that have that device support and we still want newer
guests to make use of that backend implementation.

I am sorry that's not the case, the reason we have different design as I
have mentioned above is because we want a generic mechanism which works
for all/most of the GOS's out their and doesn't need to be specific to
Linux.

I guess these points are answered above. Let me know if their is still
something amiss.
