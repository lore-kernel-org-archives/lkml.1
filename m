Jeff, did you spot real impacts of stuck dirtied_when?
Or it's simply possible in theory?

IMHO it requires extremely strong conditions to happen: It takes
months to wrap around the value, during that period it takes only
one _single_ newly dirtied inode to refresh the stuck dirtied_when. 

However...

...I see no obvious reasons against unconditionally resetting dirtied_when.

(a) Delaying an inode's writeback for 30s maybe too long - its blocking
condition may well go away within 1s. (b) And it would be very undesirable
if one big file is repeatedly redirtied hence its writeback being
delayed considerably.

However, redirty_tail() currently only tries to speedup writeback-after-redirty
in a _best effort_ way. It at best partially hides the above issues,
if there are any. In particular, if (b) is possible, the bug should
already show up at least in some situations.

For XFS, immediately sync of redirtied inode is actually discouraged:
