Vladislav, Thank you for the benchmarks! I'm very interested in
optimizing your workload and figuring out what happens underneath.

Are the client and server two standalone boxes connected by GBE?

When you set readahead sizes in the benchmarks, you are setting them
in the server side? I.e. "linux-4dtq" is the SCST server? What's the
client side readahead size?

It would help a lot to debug readahead if you can provide the
server side readahead stats and trace log for the worst case.
This will automatically answer the above questions as well as disclose
the micro-behavior of readahead:

        mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug

        echo > /sys/kernel/debug/readahead/stats # reset counters
        # do benchmark
        cat /sys/kernel/debug/readahead/stats

        echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/readahead/trace_enable
        # do micro-benchmark, i.e. run the same benchmark for a short time
        echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/readahead/trace_enable
        dmesg

The above readahead trace should help find out how the client side
sequential reads convert into server side random reads, and how we can
prevent that.

Thanks,
Fengguang
