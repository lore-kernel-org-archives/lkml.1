The design certainly isn't perfect, but neither is the one that you
suggest. For instance, what would the point of building bigger bios just
to split them _everytime_ be? That's not good design, and it's certainly
not helping performance much.

Alasdair had an idea for doing a map/unmap like interface instead, which
I think is a lot better. I don't think he ever coded it up, though.
Perhaps talk to him, if you want to improve our situation in this area.
