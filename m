We could add the +(BITS_PER_LONG - 1) logic but what for? The CPU_BITS
is defined right above and it will be increased in steps of 64.

The length of the current tle depends on the type, the next type is
located behind the current one. Expect for the typecasting and the union
trick this is what needs to be done.

The only thing that I can see that we could do is to get rid of the
unions and do the pointer arithmetic with the tl_cpu / tl_container
structs by hand. The data stored by ptf is structured in a way that
makes it rather hard to write decent C code.
