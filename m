This is, to me, a definition of a mess. Please (very strongly) don't do that.
The file is scsi/scsi.h and that's it.

I don't know for a fact but I can imagine that there was a time that Kernel
did not export any headers and glibc would sample a set every release. At some
point in time a kind soul decided that Kernel Headers should be exported from
the Kernel package and the rest is history. But he forgot that include/scsi/ is
also included. Lets just fix his simple mistake and fix this by taking back
control of Kernel headers.

If it was done so originally, but now these headers are scsi/*.h, it's
to late.

exactly it is original Kernel headers from the time they where sampled
last by glibc.
