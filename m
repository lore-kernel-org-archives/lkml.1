The gdth driver would do a register_reboot_notifier(&gdth_notifier);
to a gdth_halt() function, which would then redo half of what gdth_exit
does, and wrongly so, and crash.  

Are we guaranteed in todays kernel that modules .exit function be called
on an halt or reboot? If so then there is no need for duplications and
the gdth_halt() should go.

Submitted a patch that replaces the previous one I submitted with a deeper
fix. 
	[PATCH] gdth: bugfix for the at-exit problems

If you ask me this all gdth_flush() is a crackup. sd and scsi-ml are doing 
scsi FLUSH commands when ever is needed. The controller as no business caching
data in memory longer then what is stated in standard. Raid controller or no raid
controller. Virtual or not virtual device. Data on Plate means data on plate.
What if there is a power outage? what the driver can do then?
