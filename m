I added the 'crid' inside to support a mode of operation in which we
would like the checkpoint data to remain in memory across multiple
system calls. Here are example scenarios:

1) We will want to reduce down time by first buffering the checkpoint
image in memory, then resuming the container, and only then writing
the data back to a (the) file descriptor.
So instead of:
  freeze -> checkpoint and write back -> unfreeze
We want:
  freeze -> checkpoint to buffer -> unfreeze -> write back
I envision each of these steps to be a separate invocation of a syscall.
to the 'crid' returned by the sys_checkpoint() at the 2nd step, will be
used to identify that data in the 4th step. (Note, that between the
unfreeze and the write-back, another checkpoint may be already taken).

2) A task may want to take a checkpoint (e.g. of itself, or a whole
container) and keep that checkpoint in memory; at a later time it may
want to revert to that checkpoint. Moreover, it may keep multiple such
checkpoints (to where it may want to return). 'crid' tells sys_restart
which one to use.

Note that this 'crid' will in fact be tied to resources that are kept
by the kernel - e.g. references to COW pages (when we add that).
Louis suggested to use a specialized FD instead of a numeric 'crid'
(that is: create a anonymous inode and a struct file that represent
that checkpoint in the kernel, and return an FD to it). This approach
has pros and cons of 'crid' (see the archives of the containers
mailing list). For now I kept 'crid', but I'm definitely open to change
it to a FD.
