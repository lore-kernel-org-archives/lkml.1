It could, but if the bridge is the culprit (as it usually is for MSI
problems), this print won't help identify it.

Therefore, rather than give driver writers a recipe for "print this and
this and go to the bridge and print this", I'd rather have a single PCI
callback that prints all the (hopefully) relevant information that will
allow either fixing or blacklisting.
