I just want to make sure that you understand the code above and convince
you that this can/should be done and will damage nothing.

The code you see above is only for links that are shorter then some constant.
The ext2 (and other fs's) will cache this case and write the symlink directly
into the inode that will then have 0 number of data blocks. The space allocated
at inode is constant and is chosen for good inode packing on disk. The inode
starts empty then if a symlink is short the string is strcpy to above buffer.
So even if intentional damage was done to on-disk data, putting another null
at the end will never hurt. At most it is redundant since there is another
one preceding. But in the case of damage the damage is fixed. There can never
be an information lost.

For symlinks that are longer then above constant 1 data block is allocated
and the symlink is written, padded by zeros. This is taken care of by the
generic layer in the code you patched at fs/namei.c. Terminating at
i_size + 1 will never reach the disk since only i_size bytes are ever written.

Right that's what I thought. So my approach should be safe. Zero out at
i_size + 1
