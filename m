Answered elsewhere, but this is host-endian.  I plan to kill this
structure soon.

Written to disk, so basically, yeah.

I'm not convinced that this is needed.  Does the compiler do any padding
for alignment when it only contains char types (or structs of chars)?

Maybe, but I can't get the compiler to add any padding playing around
with variants of these structures.  I've tested a simple program on both
x86 and ppc64, but I'm not sure what would happen on, say, arm.
