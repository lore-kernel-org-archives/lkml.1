_What_ usual cases?

gendisks *ARE* reference counted, damnit.  So are net_device and a lot
of other things.  And no, it's not true that "struct net_device exists"
implies "the low-level objects that once might have been related to it
still exist" either.

Other than general ugliness and special-casing where none is really needed?
Special-casing as "very different life cycle if special method is present"...

If anything, we need to go in opposite direction - give the drivers a way
to say "my underlying object is gone, STFU and don't bother me with that
gendisk ever again; free it when you are done with it, but from now on
any access to it would better fail.  Oh, and I might find a new device
in place of that any time now, so new open() would better get not fail
just something in VFS still has a reference to that gendisk".

Which is doable - note that we can unhash block_device, dissociate inodes
from it and let new open() DTRT.  Earlier opened files will still have
a reference to address_space of original block_device (which is why we
have file->f_mapping instead of going through ->f_dentry->d_inode->i_mapping),
so we are fine.
