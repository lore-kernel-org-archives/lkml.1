That's sort of what I was reaching for too ... it just looks to me that
all the sysfs glue is in kobject, so they make a good candidate for the
pure sysfs objects.  Whatever we do, there has to be breakable cross
linking between the driver's tree and the sysfs representation ... of
course, nasty things like ksets get in the way of considering the
objects as separate, sigh.

To do this, you'll have to move at least the dentry out of the kobject,
I think.

True ... but you'll also have to implement something within sysfs to do
refcounting ... it needs to know how long to keep its nodes around.

I agree ... the question is just how to do it.

I'd favour trying to separate kobject and struct device for this ...
move all the sysfs stuff into kobject and device only stuff into struct
device ... but that would get us into disentangling the ksets, which, on
balance, isn't going to be fun ...
