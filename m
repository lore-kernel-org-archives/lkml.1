You are still mixing up the sync hint and unplugging. I'll expand it a
bit, I guess.

It tells the IO scheduler that this write is really sync, not async.
The key difference between the two is as written - the sync one will
have someone waiting for its completion. What the IO scheduler does with
the flag is its own business. In reality it means that the write is
expedited, whereas async writes are done somewhat more lazily.
