Not really sure I agree with the logic here.  I agree that its pretty clear that
its major value is for quickly testing all the algorithms in a system, but
universally failing the loading of the module simply to save a few milliseconds
seems like a poor choice.  In so doing you create an alias effect, as jarod
noted between a non-existent module and a module that failed to load.  The
aliasing can be resolved, if you want to parse dmesg, but if speed is the issue
at hand, that parsing is a significant impact.  If you allow the module to load
properly, then for the cost of an rmmod, you can tell simply from the exit code
of modprobe:
1) If the module was found 
2) If the tests passed

And if the rmmod is simply to expensive for whatever reason, then for the cost
of a few k of ram taken up by the module, you can choose not to unload it.

Of course, if tcrypt is really as much of a relic as you say, perhaps that is an
argument for removing the module entirely.  Perhaps the testmgr interface could
be exported to userspace and the tcrypt tests be packaged as a userspace suite.
