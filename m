It's a huge glue layer driver, like the aic7xxx, yes.

So the tradeoff here is that I estimate it would take years to get it to
where a linux driver should be.

Could I remind you that at the last kernel summit I was the one
advocating for holding drivers out of tree until they met our standards
and you were the one who told me not to do this ... Jon even captured
it:

I'll certainly offer this driver to Greg's drivers project to see if
they can unglue it ... I just think it's going to take a while.

Well certainly in an ideal world ... and in fact the world before KS2008
I wouldn't have accepted it until it was well cleaned up.
