I think you should comment on why we don't need to do the actual unplug.
See what I added in fs/jbd/commit.c:journal_commit_transaction():

        /*
         * Use plugged writes here, since we want to submit several
         * before we unplug the device. We don't do explicit
         * unplugging in here, instead we rely on sync_buffer() doing
         * the unplug for us.
         */
