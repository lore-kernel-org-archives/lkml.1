I have tested this patch series on ppc64, x86_64 with
dbench/tiobench/fsx, all runs fine. 

I am not sure what level of testing Amit has done about the fallocate()
and preallocation code on various archs. I couldn't find a available
s390 and ia64 machines with free partition yet.

In any case, it would be useful to add a new set of testsuites for the
new fallocate() syscall and fsstress in LTP testsuites to automatically
the preallocation code in ext4/XFS.
