Thanks, that's really helpful.

I think you're right, fix looks good.

I don't think the caller can rely on that if it returns failure.
But that is more defensive I guess. Maybe setting it to 1 or
so would catch abusers.

I don't know why myself :P I think it would be just fine to use
len-1 as it did previously, so it must have been a typo?

OK thanks. I would rather just change this to use the length of
the first iovec always (prefaulting multiple iovecs would have to
be benchmarked on real apps that make heavy use of writev, I
suspect).

Can we just change it to the original order? That would seem to be
safest unless one of the ext3 devs explicitly acks it.
