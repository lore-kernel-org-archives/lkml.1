Eh?

No, I'd not expect that option to panic systems. That's why I
suggested:

diff --git a/fs/xfs/Kconfig b/fs/xfs/Kconfig
index 29228f5..b7ac847 100644
--- a/fs/xfs/Kconfig
+++ b/fs/xfs/Kconfig
@@ -77,4 +77,7 @@ config XFS_DEBUG
 	  Note that the resulting code will be HUGE and SLOW, and probably
 	  not useful unless you are debugging a particular problem.
 
+	  Turning this option on will result in kernel panicking any time
+	  it detects on-disk corruption.
+
 	  Say N unless you are an XFS developer, or you play one on TV.
