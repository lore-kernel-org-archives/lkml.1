  The user is notified about either exceeding his quota softlimit or
reaching hardlimit. If you are interested in more details, please ask.

  Quite infrequent... Users won't exceed their quotas too often :).

  Generic netlink should take care of this - arguments are typed so it
knows how much bits numbers have. So this should be no issue. Are there any
other problems that you have in mind?

  Generic netlink can be used to pass this information (although in OOM
situation, it may be a bit hairy to get the network stack working...). But
I guess it's not related to my patch.
