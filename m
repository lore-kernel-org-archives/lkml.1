Is it really?  Man nfs says something quite different (emphasis mine):

   intr        If an NFS file operation has a *major timeout* and  it  is
               hard  mounted,  then  allow signals to interupt the file
               operation and cause it to return EINTR  to  the  calling
               program.  The *default* is to *not* allow file operations to
               be *interrupted*.

It's not FUD, it's being careful not to break an implementation when
changing an API in a backward incompatbile way.

I have already done so:

  "Also up till now, returning ESTALE in a fuse filesystem was a
   perfectly valid thing to do.  This patch changes the behavior of
   that rather drastically.  There might be installed systems that
   rely on current behavior, and we want to avoid breaking those on a
   kernel upgrade."
