I just recompiled 2.6.23.9 with the 64 bit patch for dpt_i2o and now it
boots just fine.

The patch is here:
http://www.miquels.cistron.nl/linux/dpt_i2o-64bit-2.6.23.patch

It's not the final version - it needs a few cleanups before it can be
submitted, but perhaps you can test if it also works for you.

Mike.
