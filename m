You can't make any assumptions about that.  Probably most of them 
don't.

Your suggestion above ought to work out okay, if you remove each device
from the list yourself as you come to it.  (I don't think that will
cause problems elsewhere, but I could be wrong.)  However, struct kset
contains a spinlock which is supposed to protect the list.  This loop
should be using the spinlock.
