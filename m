Use of config options like that is a bad precedence I think, which is
why I commented on it .. Since we have a vread pointer that exists
already, and it's used a very similar purpose it seems like bloat to
just add another pointer.. 

We could change the vread to be a plain void pointer, then let each
architecture use it however they want.
