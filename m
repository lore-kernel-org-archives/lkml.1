Subject: [PATCH] dm: max_segments=1 if merge_bvec_fn is not supported
Message-ID: <20100306211012.GA9689@racke>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

If the lower device exposes a merge_bvec_fn,
dm_set_device_limits() restricts max_sectors
to PAGE_SIZE "just to be safe".

This is not sufficient, however.

If someone uses bio_add_page() to add 8 disjunct 512 byte partial
pages to a bio, it would succeed, but could still cross a border
of whatever restrictions are below us (e.g. raid10 stripe boundary).
An attempted bio_split() would not succeed, because bi_vcnt is 8.

One example that triggered this frequently is the xen io layer.

raid10_make_request bug: can't convert block across chunks or bigger than 64k 209265151 1

Neil: you may want to double check linear.c and raid*.c for similar logic,
even though it is unlikely that someone puts md raid6 on top of something
exposing a merge_bvec_fn.

This is not the first time this has been patched, btw.
See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=440093
