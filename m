Subject: [PATCH v4 00/13] snapshot-merge target
Date: Fri, 20 Nov 2009 15:27:40 -0500
Message-Id: <1258748873-24185-1-git-send-email-snitzer@redhat.com>
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The snapshot-merge target allows a snapshot to be merged back into the
snapshot's origin device.

One expected use of snapshot merging is the rollback of a root
filesystem after system upgrades (e.g.: yum update).  snapshot-merge
enables "system rollback" support for any filesystem that is using the
associated DM/LVM devices.

* "[PATCH v4 05/13] dm snapshot: add snapshot-merge target" adds further
  documentation to: Documentation/device-mapper/snapshot.txt

* All patch headers have been revised/audited for added clarity.

* Both the latest handover (v10) and origin-write patch have been
  included in this series.

* Aside from snapshot-merge specific testing these patches have
  survived 75+ iterations of lvm2's testsuite without any failures.
  The test kernel was 2.6.32-rc8 and lvm2 was 2.0.55 (with udev_sync
  enabled and dmeventd disabled).

The snapshot-merge quilt tree is maintained here:
http://people.redhat.com/msnitzer/patches/snapshot-merge/kernel/2.6.33/

For LVM2 support please see:
