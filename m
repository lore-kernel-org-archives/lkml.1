Hello, generally the load is low, it mainly serves out some samba shares.

Yes, the XFS threads show up like this on each time the kernel crashed.  So far
with 2.6.30.9 after ~48hrs+ it has not crashed.  So it appears to be some issue
between 2.6.30.9 and 2.6.31.x when this began happening.  Any recommendations
on how to catch this bug w/certain options enabled/etc?
