One other way to think about this is as a fairly normal queuing problem:

    (1) arrival rate is the rate at which we see new tasks coming into 
the code
    (2) service time is basically the time spent committing the 
transaction to storage

and we have the assumption that some number of tasks can join a 
transaction more or less for "free."

What the existing code assumes is that all devices have an equal service 
time. That worked well as long as we only looked at devices that were 
roughly equal (10-20 ms latencies) or used a higher HZ for the kernel 
(1000HZ and you don't see this as much as with 100HZ).

The two key issues that Josef's code tried to address are that first 
assumption that all devices have a similar service time and the tie 
between how long we wait and the HZ. It would seem to be generically 
useful to be able to sleep for less than 1 jiffie, not just for file 
systems, but maybe also in some other contexts?
