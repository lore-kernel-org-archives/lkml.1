Pretty cool stuff.

I've been wondering when we would start seeing OSD filesystems make 
their appearance.

Random, unordered comments:

* This is important stuff.  Should have been posted to LKML.  Please CC 
LKML in the future.

* As discussed at the filesystem summit, OSD use implies a need for an 
MD-like layer for OSD objects.  Has anyone even started the design work 
for this?

* I tend to think there is room for more than one OSD filesystem in the 
Linux kernel.  Assuming all OSDs will use the same Linux filesystem 
driver will lead to bloat, and you potentially "code yourself into a 
corner."  Let's not rule out multiple filesystems.

As such, "osdfs" seems like too-generic a name. How about boazfs?  :)

* Get this into the kernel ASAP!  OSD stuff languishes outside the 
kernel for _far_ too long.  OSD is a key storage technology that needs 
to be developed in the full light of the Linux community, not off in a 
dark corner somewhere, where few see progress or discussions.

Object-based storage, and its SCSI incarnation OSD, is a MAJOR revision 
of the block storage API, moving away from LBA-addressed linear APIs. 
That's a big deal, and should be discussed on LKML, IMO...
