Exactly yes.

As you suggested, I already change 4G to 2G on ppc.

I think I have already explained the reason in a previous email, I just 
don't know if '2G - reserved_memory' is safe for ppc or not. What is the 
minimum memory size for a normal kernel to run on ppc? And how is it if 
I configure PAGE_SIZE > 4K, e.g. 64K?

Thanks!
