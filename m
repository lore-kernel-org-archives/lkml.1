Hmm, now that I look again, those ioctls it's complaining
about are ones for which we just return ENOTTY, so I guess 
we don't really need them listed explicitly, and if they
weren't, the Kconfig patch would be unnecessary.

Well, with SCSI turned off, it didn't compile:


drivers/block/cciss.c: In function `cciss_ioctl':
drivers/block/cciss.c:1180: error: `SCSI_IOCTL_GET_IDLUN' undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/block/cciss.c:1180: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
drivers/block/cciss.c:1180: error: for each function it appears in.)
drivers/block/cciss.c:1181: error: `SCSI_IOCTL_GET_BUS_NUMBER' undeclared (first use in this function)
make[2]: *** [drivers/block/cciss.o] Error 1

Erm, I don't think this is necessary: SG_IO is a property of the block
layer, not SCSI (as in it will work without SCSI even present).  SCSI
has a special driver: the sg driver that has its own implementation of
SG_IO, but that's the only connection.
