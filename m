The problem is usually not with what the vendor ships, but what the 
carrier delivers. Bad handling does happen, "drop ship" can have several 
meanings, and I have received shipments with the "G sensor" in the case 
triggered. Zero is a handy source of data, but the important thing is to 
look at the relocated sector count before and after the write. If there 
are a lot of bad sectors initially, the drive is probably a poor choice 
for anything critical.
