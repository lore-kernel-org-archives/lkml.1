My thought too, so I tried that, but many are still used like so:

	module_param_call(foo, set_foo, param_get_uint, NULL, 0644);

They can all be replaced in time with something like:
	static int param_get_foo(char *buffer, const struct kernel_param *kp)
	{
		return param_ops_uint.get(buffer, kp);
	}

But it'll take a transition period.

Thanks!
Rusty.
