Currently that is true, but i think isolating netlink sockets is going
to have to be done pretty soon.

On the one hand cloning a new netlink socket ns when you unshare
CLONE_NEWNET may seem 'obvious', but I think doing so when you unshare
CLONE_NEWUSER make much more sense considering netlink's use for audit
and now for quota.

Even with isolating netlink we still may want to send out an identifier.
However, just as with mounts extensions we're printing out the memory
address of vfsmounts, we might just want to print out the memory address
of the userns.  It's not universal, but should be good enough.
