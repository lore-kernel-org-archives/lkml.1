Yes, the intention is to make ionice be able to work correctly over
device mapper modules such as software-raid and the multipath driver.
This mechanism is needed since quite a few device mapper modules have
kernel threads, including workqueues, handle I/O requests.

And I also have a plan to use this new feature for block I/O bandwidth
control based on cgroup with some enhancement. With this feature, we
can also trace the iocontext of the process or cgroup which made
a certain page dirtied.


Thank you,
