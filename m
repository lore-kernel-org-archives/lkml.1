Aehhm, .. what ? If a user does not understand a message directly
how can he NOT be interested in the kmsg tag? As a random example
consider the situation when the user gets the message

	monwriter.1: Writing monitor data failed with rc=5

Usually a user will go "Huh?" except if he is a z/VM expert. Looking
at the source code won't help too much either:

static int monwrite_diag(struct monwrite_hdr *myhdr, char *buffer, int fcn)
{
        struct appldata_product_id id;
        int rc;

        strcpy(id.prod_nr, "LNXAPPL");
        id.prod_fn = myhdr->applid;
        id.record_nr = myhdr->record_num;
        id.version_nr = myhdr->version;
        id.release_nr = myhdr->release;
        id.mod_lvl = myhdr->mod_level;
        rc = appldata_asm(&id, fcn, (void *) buffer, myhdr->datalen);
        if (rc <= 0)
                return rc;
        if (rc == 5)
                return -EPERM;
        kmsg_err(1,"Writing monitor data failed with rc=%i\n", rc);
        return -EINVAL;
}

What the user should do is to cut-copy-paste the kmsg tag monwriter.1
and pass it to man:

# man monwriter.1

What the user will then get is the man page that has been generated
from the kmsg comment with "make D=2":

--- snip
monwriter.1(9)                                                  monwriter.1(9)

Message
       monwriter.1: Writing monitor data failed with rc=%i

Severity
       Error

Parameters
       @1: return code

Description
       The  monitor  stream  application  device driver used the z/VM diagnose
       call DIAG X'DC' to start writing monitor data. z/VM returned  an  error
       and  the  monitor data cannot be written. If the return code is 5, your
       z/VM guest virtual machine is not authorized to write monitor data.

User action
       If the return code is 5, ensure that your z/VM guest virtual  machine's
       entry in the z/VM directory includes the OPTION APPLMON statement.  For
       other return codes see the section about DIAGNOSE Code X'DC'  in  "z/VM
       CP Programming Services".

LINUX                           Linux Messages                  monwriter.1(9)
--- snip

Now the user actually gets help: the description tells him that rc=5
probably is because the virtual machine is not authorized. The key to
be able to get to the description associated to a message is the kmsg
tag.

By the way the kmsg comment for monwriter.1 is as follows just in case
you are wondering:

/*?
 * Tag: monwriter.1
 * Text: "Writing monitor data failed with rc=%i"
 * Severity: Error
 * Parameter:
 *   @1: return code
 * Description:
 * The monitor stream application device driver used the z/VM diagnose call
 * DIAG X'DC' to start writing monitor data. z/VM returned an error and the
 * monitor data cannot be written. If the return code is 5, your z/VM guest
 * virtual machine is not authorized to write monitor data.
 * User action:
 * If the return code is 5, ensure that your z/VM guest virtual machine's
 * entry in the z/VM directory includes the OPTION APPLMON statement.
 * For other return codes see the section about DIAGNOSE Code X'DC'
 * in "z/VM CP Programming Services".
