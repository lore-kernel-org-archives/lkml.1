Well, I can ... even though SCSI is one of the major users of select in
the tree.

The argument goes that abuse of select is very easy to do ... just over
select on a lot of options.  The result is pieces of the kernel get
built in and you have a devil of a time trying to work out how to get
them to be turned off (this is annoying when you get bugs that say
without feature X enabled, Y bug happens).

Conversely depends has the opposite problem: config options disappear
for no readily apparent reason (at least until you read the Kconfig
file, then it becomes apparent).

What I try to do in SCSI is sort our Kconfig features into primary and
subsidiary, so primary features (like HBA drivers) are allowed to select
subsidiary features (like transport classes).  However, for most other
cases, we use depends instead.

Yes, over use of select trips across this fairly quickly.

Yes, that works for libsas ... but what do we do about the prototypes in
firmware.h ... just take away the stub and force everything relying on
it to break so we can put in a Kconfig sequence like the above?

They don't currently seem to work for compiled in drivers ... we have
the same issue with drivers that actually need firmware (like aic94xx or
qla2xxx): no-one seems to have figured out how to provide it for them;
it seems the device is already initialised and has failed to find its
firmware before the initrd/initramfs is running.

Right ... that's more or less my argument about how far do we really
need to go to make Kconfig foolproof.
