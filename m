Apologies, that was indeed a behavioral change introduced in a commit
that claimed just to be shuffling code around.

The assumption must have been that -EAGAIN could only mean that we
needed to keep blocking, and hence was a nonsensical return from a
filesystem lock method that waited itself for the lock to become
available--such a method would return 0, -EINTR (or some more exotic
error), or continue waiting.

If we agree that EAGAIN is actually a legimate error to return from a
blocking lock, then, yes, we need take ->lock() back out of this loop.

And I don't think there's any real reason we need the new behavior.  So
we should probably revert that--I'll take a closer look tomorrow....
