Yes, that would be a much cleaner fix. It's good to hear that you're
working on it. Another approach for fixing this in the NFSv4 code did
occur to me too:

We could have nfs4_intent_set_file call lookup_instantiate_filp with an
open function pointer that's different from nfs_file_open. That function
would basically do what nfs_file_open does now. We could then fix
nfs_file_open to do a stateful open when it gets a filp with no state.

Until you have the VFS open interface fixed that might be the safest
approach in case there are other ways to skip dentry revalidation that
we haven't identified yet.

As Miklos pointed out, removing the file on the server would make even
those invalid...

A new fs_flag sounds like a reasonable idea. Assuming that I didn't
break the refcounting, my main worry with the set I have so far is that
it'll slow down path walking. A new fs_flag should help minimize that
for filesystems where this isn't an issue.
