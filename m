Extreme apologies, but I had a mailer hiccup and totally botched
the first attempt at mailing this series.

Please disregard that earlier attempt.

v1 -> v2:
	- no changes to patches; only fixed mail addresses

It was recently discovered that some BIOS implementations load
dynamic SSDTs when a processor's _PDC method is evaluated.

	http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14824
	http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14710

In Linux, we do not evaluate _PDC until after we initialize the EC.

Unfortunately, that same BIOS references objects in the dynamic
table during EC enablement. So we get undefined references to
methods during enablement, and we fail to initialize certain pieces
of hardware.

Windows works just fine on this machine, so to me, this is a hint
that Linux should be evaluating _PDC much earlier.

The first patch in this series does just that and makes Linux
more compatible with Windows' ACPI implementation.

The remaining 10 patches unify the x86/ia64 implementations of
calling _PDC. I noticed the two archs were way more similar than
they were different, so I thought it made sense to combine them
as much as possible.

This patch series was built on both x86 and ia64 (checkpatch and
sparse clean).

It was also boot tested on an HP Envy 15 (x86) and an HP rx6600
(ia64). It resolved the namespace failures on the Envy 15 and did
not cause any regressions on the rx6600.

This does introduce a boot time namespace walk for all the CPUs
in the system, looking for and evaluating _PDC. Hopefully that
will not make life miserable for the giant SGI clusters. If worse
comes to worse, maybe we can quirk them and avoid the namespace
walk.
