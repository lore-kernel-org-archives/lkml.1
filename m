The whole subsystem is created at compile time, but controller data
structures are allocated dynamically (i.e. see struct mem_cgroup for
memory controller). So, identifying each device with a name, or a key
like major,minor, instead of a reference/pointer to a struct could help
to handle this in userspace. I mean, if a device is unplugged a
userspace daemon can just handle the event and delete the controller
data structures allocated for this device, asynchronously, via
userspace->kernel interface. And without holding a reference to that
particular block device in the kernel. Anyway, implementing a generic
interface that would allow to define hooks for hot-pluggable devices (or
similar events) in cgroups would be interesting.

Correct. Proportional bandwidth automatically allows to guarantee min
requirements (instead of IO limiting approach, that needs additional
mechanisms to achive this).

In any case there's no guarantee for a cgroup/application to sustain
i.e. 10MB/s on a certain device, but this is a hard problem anyway, and
the best we can do is to try to satisfy "soft" constraints.
