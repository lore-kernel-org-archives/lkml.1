Also worth considering is that spending minutes trying to reread
damaged sectors is likely to accelerate your death spiral. More data
may be recoverable if you give up quickly in a first pass, then go
back and manually retry damaged bits with smaller I/Os.

Another approach is to have separate retries per hard sector and
hard errors per MB at the block device level. We don't want to have
the same number of retries for a 64KB block as a 1MB block and we
certainly don't want to do 2K retries in a row.

So for instance, I could have the first set to 1 and the second set to
16. For a 256KB read, this gets scaled down to 4, which means we'll
retry each sector once and fail the whole I/O when we hit the 5th
sector error.

More reasonable number might be 0 and 1, meaning "don't do OS level
retries on sectors and fail the whole I/O on the second sector error
(or immediately for smaller reads)".

It might also be informative to add a kernel message reporting if a retry
(in the non-transient cases) ever actually succeeds.
