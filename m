you need to, otherwise you are claiming that all linux software raid 
implementations will loose data on powerfail, which I don't think is the 
case.

it's the same combination of problems (non-redundant array and write lost 
to powerfail/reboot), just in a different order.

reccomending a scrub of the raid after an unclean shutdown would make 
sense, along with a warning that if you loose all redundancy before the 
scrub is completed and there was a write failure in the unscrubbed portion 
it could corrupt things.

what about dm raid?

I don't think you should talk about hardware raid cards.

this definition of data loss wasn't clear prior to this. you need to 
define this, and state that the reason that flash and raid arrays can 
suffer from this is that both of them deal with blocks of storage larger 
than the data block (eraseblock or raid stripe) and there are conditions 
that can cause the loss of the entire eraseblock or raid stripe which can 
affect data that was previously safe on disk (and if power had been lost 
before the latest write, the prior data would still be safe)

note that this doesn't nessasarily affect all flash disks. if the disk 
doesn't replace the old block in the FTL until the data has all been 
sucessfuly copies to the new eraseblock you don't have this problem.

some (possibly all) cheap thumb drives don't do this, but I would expect 
that the expensive SATA SSDs to do things in the right order.

do this right and you are properly documenting a failure mode that most 
people don't understand, but go too far and you are crying wolf.
