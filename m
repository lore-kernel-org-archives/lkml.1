Even worse, your data is potentially gone and you have not noticed 
it...  This is why array vendors and archival storage products do 
periodic scans of all stored data (read all the bytes, compared to a 
digital signature, etc).

Part of documenting best practices is to put down very specific things 
that do/don't work. What I worry about is producing too much detail to 
be of use for real end users.

I have to admit that I have not paid enough attention to this specifics 
of your ext3 + flash card issue - is it the ftl stuff doing out of order 
IO's?

Your statement is overly broad - ext3 on a commercial RAID array that 
does RAID5 or RAID6, etc has no issues that I know of.

Do you know first hand that ZFS works on flash cards?

Again, you say RAID5 without enough specifics.  Are you pointing just at 
MD RAID5 on S-ATA? Hardware RAID cards? A specific commercial RAID5 vendor?

Documentation is fine with sufficient, hard data....
