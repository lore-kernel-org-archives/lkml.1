I think and I speak for my patches, you should look at soft limit
reclaim as helping global reclaim and not working against it. It
provides an opportunity to reclaim from groups that might not be
important to the system.

Not true, with my patches none of these are affected since the reclaim
for soft limits is limited to mem cgroup LRU lists only. Zone reclaim
that happens in parallel can of-course change the global LRU.

I don't like the results, they are functionaly broken (see my other
email). Why should "B" get reclaimed from if it is not above its soft
limit? Why is there a swapout from "B"?

The code seems to add a lot of complexity and does not achieve expected
functionality. I am going to start testing this series soon
