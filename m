I can resend it with that CC, no problem.  It's a good experience to
learn git and how to use it properly.

Umm, no.  My main machine for the past six or seven years is Debian
based, and came from the 2.4 era of kernels and has been patched and
upgraded for years by hand.  Lots of 'atp-get update'.  Whcih works
well.  So I've also compiled my own kernels.

The real reason for this patch was finally figuring out that Udev
really really really wants this turned on, but doesn't mention it in
any of it's documentation.  So I'm working to update both sides, and
have UDEV mention that it needs this feature, and making the kernel
turn it on by default too.

I'll resend the patch in a few.

John
