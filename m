Sure, it's easy to find drivers, which that return a non-dummy value from
the remove() callback thinking that someone up there will take care of the
error.

The point is, however, that

1) the SGI Indy SCSI controller driver doesn't compile cleanly [2], and
SCSI maintainers do not apply the patch because, in principle, the
(*remove)() callback should not return int since the return value is
discarded [1];

2) the changes in the platform driver framework are, as it seems, not
acceptable because the non-dummy return values can, in principle, be used
for error checking.

All that I actually care about is to get rid of this:

<<<

  CC [M]  drivers/scsi/sgiwd93.o
drivers/scsi/sgiwd93.c:314: warning: initialization from incompatible
pointer type

<<<

I don't care whether the compilation warning is gone because [2] is
applied, or the entire platform driver framework is combed though to
change int to void.

Thanks,
Dmitri
