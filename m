In the case of SN Altix, the return value (with my patch) will always
be 0xffffffffffffffffull. So, your check would work. And just as the
current code's ia64_platform_is("sn2") check would always return TRUE
on any SN2 system, so would your proposed use of dma_get_required_mask().

However, for SN2, memory size or location cannot be inferred from the
return value, as it has no affect on the returned value.
As Documentation/DMA-API.txt says:
    "This API returns the mask that the platform requires to
    operate efficiently."

And for SN2, this is always a 64 bit mask, irregardless of memory size,
location, etc.

OK, I must not be understanding something. check_crashkernel_memory()
appears to be coded to handle 3 or more platforms (sn2, uv, and others).
