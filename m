Hm, I think without utrace, it gets out-of-sync once, so syscall entries
and exits are swapped from that point on. With utrace, it gets
out-of-sync _twice_, so it eventually looks fine. But the strace output
definitely looks incorrect even with utrace:

5718  execve("./test2.sh", [], [/* 23 vars */]) = 1
5718  execve("", [0x840c001000100003, 0x26230c14203032, 0x8cb0008800140a81, 0xa643100801808402, 0x2400905000040088, 0x11600a0072000001, 0xad814a00402e0, 0x2200012464009344, 0x1180418512c40026, 0x400003081880008, 0x2100010840910404, 0x8045120000800003, 0x6400000c0000600, 0xc20063440501400, 0x1048015002008081, 0xe02226005008c010, ...], [/* 0 vars */]) = 1
5718  access("/etc/ld.so.preload", R_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

Note that strace missed a brk() syscall, although I can actually see
this in the other trace you sent me:

wait4(-1, [{WIFSTOPPED(s) && WSTOPSIG(s) == SIGTRAP}], __WALL, NULL) = 5704
ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKUSER, 5704, psr, NULL) = 4398046511120
ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKUSER, 5704, r15, NULL) = 1060
ptrace(PTRACE_SYSCALL, 5704, 0x1, SIG_0) = 0

Look at the value of r15, and compare it with unistd.h:
#define __NR_brk                        1060

I _guess_ this is caused by the fact that test2.sh is a shell script, so
the kernel executes the shell, and maybe utrace produces a second execve
notifications in this case? Roland, can you shed some light?
