(thanks, Roland for pointing out that I'm incorrect about code being
called)

No, I can't, which is why I find it hard to like the idea of "use

my preferred way (a new verb for /proc/scsi/scsi) isn't liked by others.
So here we stand.

Come up with a sensible suggestion, and I'll listen to you.  Code isn't
the issue.  API is the issue.
