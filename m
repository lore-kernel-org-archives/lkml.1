Hmmm... so two separate meaning depending on command success/failure?
I doubt high level code or user application can make much use out of
raw transfer byte count.  It doesn't mean all that much as it varies
depending on specific transport protocol in use.

Shouldn't those be request successful w/ sense data?  Please note that
the term "error" in this context means failure of block layer request
not SCSI layer CHECK SENSE.

And these are request failures.

This is something to be interpreted by lld, be it usb or scsi layer,
from block layer POV, if it's partial completion, it's success w/
residue count.  If nothing really happened, it's request failure.

I'm still reluctant to do it because...

* Its definition still isn't clear (well, at least to me) and if it's
  defined as the number of valid bytes on request success and the
  number of bytes HBA transferred on request failure, I don't think
  it's all that useful.

* Seen from userland, residue count on request failure has never been
  guaranteed and there doesn't seem to be any valid in kernel user.

* It would be extra code explicitly setting the residue count to full
  on failure path.  If it's something necessary, full residue count on
  failure needs to be made default.  If not, it will only add more
  confusion.

Thanks.
