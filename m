Yeah, this is very true.  My guess is that we'll need something like
what we do with modversions.

Sure thing.  Will do.

Can't we just declare all these things __packed__ and stop worrying
about aligning them all manually?

Ugh, this is crappy code anyway.  It needs to return an error and have
someone else handle it.

I have to wonder if this is just a symptom of us trying to do this the
wrong way.  We're trying to talk the kernel into writing internal gunk
into a FD.  You're right, it is like a splice where one end of the pipe
is in the kernel.

Any thoughts on a better way to do this?

Yes, eventually.  I think one good point is that we should probably
remove this now so that we *have* to think about security implications
as we add each individual patch.  For instance, what kind of checking do
we do when we restore an mlock()'d VMA?

I'll pull this check out so it causes pain. (the good kind)

Fine with me.  Renamed in new patches, hopefully.

I'll send new patches out later today.
