I guess this pins it as an XFS problem pretty solidly.

This test looks like it should consist solely of open-for-append and
write on about 20k files in the target directory. Because of the
--pull, no hardlinks are involved. It shouldn't be all that different
from doing tar cf - a | tar xf - b.

The files get visited in alphabetical order, so the start of the
corruption may be telling.
