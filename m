I will fix the changelogs as following.

-----------------------------------------------------------
The timeout feature is added to "freeze ioctl" to solve a deadlock
when the freezer accesses a frozen filesystem. And new ioctl
to reset the timeout period is added to extend the timeout period.
For example, the freezer resets the timeout period to 10 seconds every 5
seconds.  In this approach, even if the freezer causes a deadlock by
accessing the frozen filesystem, it will be solved by the timeout
in 10 seconds and the freezer will be able to recognize that
at the next reset of timeout period.
-----------------------------------------------------------

I think the management software for the storage device
will use these ioctls to take a consistent backup.

I will clean it up.

It isn't needed, I will delete it.

I will rename the names of these global symbols.
For example, "add_fsfreeze_timeout"...

I think so.

In my current implementation,
the delayed work task calls thaw_bdev() to unfreeze a filesystem
and it calls del_freeze_timeout().  So, the deadlock occurs.
But I've found that the delayed work task doesn't need to call
del_freeze_timeout() because it is removed
from the delayed work queue automatically after the work finishes.
So I will fix thaw_bdev() so that it doesn't call
del_freeze_timeout() only when it's called by the delayed work task.
And I will delete delayed_work_pending() in del_freeze_timeout().

Cheers, Takashi
