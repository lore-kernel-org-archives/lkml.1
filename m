I ran this twice, killing power after 'renames ready'. The first time it
was fine, the second time I got:

centera:~/e2fsprogs-1.40.9/e2fsck # ./e2fsck -f /dev/sdb1
e2fsck 1.40.9 (27-Apr-2008)

Invalid HTREE directory inode 2395569 (/barrier-test).  Clear HTree
index<y>? yes

Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity
Pass 3A: Optimizing directories
Duplicate entry
'0650419c70f3beadaa9a2c2f4999745a9c02066a0650419c70f3beadaa9a2c2f4999745a9c02066a0650419c70f3beadaa9a2c2f4999745a9c02066a0650419c70f3beadaa9a2c2f4999745a9c02066a0650419c70f3beadaa9a2c2f4999745a9c02066a0650419c70f3beadaa9a2c2f4999745a9c02066a.0'
in /barrier-test (2395569) found.  Clear? yes

and tons of 'duplicate entry' errors after that. And then

Pass 4: Checking reference counts
Inode 168 ref count is 0, should be 1.  Fix? yes

Unattached zero-length inode 255.  Clear? yes

Inode 1221 ref count is 0, should be 1.  Fix? yes

Inode 1253 ref count is 1, should be 2.  Fix? yes

Inode 2692 ref count is 0, should be 1.  Fix? yes

Inode 3465 ref count is 0, should be 1.  Fix? yes

and lots of those too. So definitely easy to trigger. Test fs was ext3
of 40gb on a 320gb maxtor drive.
