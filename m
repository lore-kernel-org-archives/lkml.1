My interest in SAS/SATA RAID controllers (e.g. cciss and megaraid)
is to get to the physical drives and let smartmontools query
them. The first difficulty is addressing physical drives within
the logical drive presented to the OS. Then there are SATA drives:
I have yet to see a SAT implementation good enough to fetch
useful SMART data using "pure" SCSI commands; that leaves the
SAT ATA PASS-THROUGH commands.

Testing I did today on a HP E200 controller with version 1.80
firmware and the cciss driver in lk 2.6.27 showed this command
failed (as it has in the past):
     smartctl -a -d cciss,0 /dev/cciss/c0d0
when c0d0 was a SATA disk.

Yes, I know the documentation says it won't work and I've been told
not to hold my breadth.
So if a true SCSI cciss driver might appear, could SAT with
ATA pass-through support be added to the wish list?


BTW We now have the equivalent working on megaraid controllers.
Whether to let "SCSI" commands through that alter the state
of a SATA disk is an interesting dilemma for the driver.
WRITEs are obviously a no-no but the current megaraid/smartctl
code ignored my attempts to do a self-test.
