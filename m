I just noticed the same bug when I tried to update a 2.6.18 server to
2.6.23.9 .. also tried 2.6.24-rc4. The symptom I'm seeing is that init
segfaults, or can't be found .. anyway, driver/fs errors.

In the kernel config, under "processor type and features", I disabled
"64GB memory" support (changed to 4GB) and I also disabled "64 bit
Memory and IO resources" and the problem went away. Do you by any chance
happen to have those features enabled ?

The dpt_i2o driver is not 64-bit clean, it happens to work with
PAE/64-bit dma in earlier kernels but that might be by chance. Perhaps
the different initialization ordering exposes the problem.

I got the 64-bit dpt_i2o driver from Adaptec some time ago, and I have
added 64-bit support to the 2.6.23.1 dpt_i2o driver based on that
driver. I intended to submit it for 2.6.25 or so ... if I have some time
later today or tomorrow I'll try that next to see if that makes a
difference.

Mike.
