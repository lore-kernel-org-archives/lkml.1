OK, back on the ball; the names of the patches you're referring to are
in master:/home/akpm/public_html/mmotm/broken-out

No.  pci-enable-msi-on-8132.patch alone should fix the box.  Without it,
the MSI routing isn't working properly.

The fact that MSI is affecting fusion is caused by this patch:

commit 23a274c8a5adafc74a66f16988776fc7dd6f6e51
Author: Prakash, Sathya <sathya.prakash@lsi.com>
Date:   Fri Mar 7 15:53:21 2008 +0530

    [SCSI] mpt fusion: Enable MSI by default for SAS controllers
 
However that wasn't correctly implemented and had to be fixed, but the
bottom line is that with this patch as fixes, fusion now tries to enable
MSI for the SAS card (and has since 2.6.26)

A recent patch that went in to 2.6.29-rc2 was

commit e382968ba618e016ff7922dff9a6140c2f9108c8
Author: Kashyap, Desai <kashyap.desai@lsi.com>
Date:   Thu Jan 8 14:27:16 2009 +0530

    [SCSI] mpt fusion: Add separate msi enable disable for FC,SPI,SAS

This was misimplemented and actually disables MSI globally in the driver
(contrary to what LSI wanted to do).

What mpt-fix-enable-lsi-sas-to-use-msi-as-default.patch is fix this and
re-enable MSI by default on SAS cards (going back to the position we
were in after 23a274c8a5adafc74a66f16988776fc7dd6f6e51).

What I'm saying is I'm happy to wait for LSI to sort out the current
mess ... hopefully dynamically, and in the meantime, MSI being globally
disabled for fusion isn't really a problem.
