I used evms to setup mine.  I have used mdadm in the past.  I use lvm ontop
of it which evms makes it a little easier to maintain.  I have 3 arrays
total (only the raid5 was configured by evms, the other 2 raid1s were done
by hand)

I only have 2 ext3 file systems (One of which is mounted R/O since it's
full), all my others are reiserfs (v3).

What benefit would I gain by using an external journel and how big would it
need to be?

I specifically didn't use XFS (or JFS) since neither one at the time could
be shrinked.
