That is happening because links == 0...

Size and blockcount of zero as well. Delete time matching atime and
mtime. It looks like something deleted the inode from underneath the
directory entry. The question, of course, is why...

Is it possible that the filesystem still had lingering corruption from
my earlier bad patch? I take it you ran fsck over the filesystem and
it didn't report any errors, but did you run it with -f to force the
check? Deletion of a spurious link to the inode (that wasn't properly
accounted for in the link count) would cause the problem you see.

BTW, apologies for that bad patch, and thanks for identifying it so quickly.

Cheers,
Duane.
