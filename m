You could add something like
|for dev in $rootdev $resumedevs; do
|       info="$(cryptsetup luksDump $rootdev)"
|       if [ $? -ne 0]; then
|               # Partition is now encrypted
|               continue
|       fi
|       cipher="$(cryptsetup luksDump /dev/md1 |grep "Cipher name:" | \
|            sed 's@^Cipher name:\s\+@@')"
|       add_crypto_modules $cipher
|       mode="$(cryptsetup luksDump /dev/md1 |grep "Cipher name:")"
|       echo "$mode" | sed \
|               -e 's@^Cipher name:\s\+@@') \
|               -e 's@-@ @' \
|               -e 's@:@ @'
|       # mode is now "<block_mode> <IV_mode> <hash>"
|       blk_mode=$(echo $mode | awk '{print $1}'
|       hash=$(echo $mode | awk '{print $3})'
|       add_crypto_modules $blk_mode
|       add_crypto_modules $hash
|done       
instead of hardcoding cbc, aes & sha256

Why is a minimal initramsfs here a good thing here? 1 MiB isn't that
huge and with gzip it does not grow much. Here is an example on my amd64
with current initramfs as of 2.6.30-1-amd64:
picky       : 10511917 bytes / 11 MiB
full crypto : 10729154 bytes / 11 MiB / + 2.1%

So. On AMD64 we are talking here about 200KiB or 2% of the whole image
size.
If arch/*/crypto grows than just because there is more support and this
is a good thing not bad.

ah so my little script was not required. What about d-i? AFAIK that one
runs from initramfs and relies on modules which are selected here. Isn't
this the case?

>i added cryptomgr, chainiv and krng to the list of required modules in

And in .32 you have work again because you need eseqiv.

exactly. Plus runtime dependency.

I don't the like extra work for 2%. Even if someone does this, you still
have lets say the geode, via-padlock and the hfin driver on a 486 system
which can't use all of them and relies on pure SW. No benefit there.

Okay. You put the crypto modules in initramfs in case the root partition
and or swap is encrypted. In case just /data is encrypted you don't need
those modules at all. So d-i needs all them in case the user might want
to xts(twofish) and not just the standard thing. The user-initramfs
script could take the full set of crypto modules if it is building a new
initramfs and grab the list of required modules from lsmod if the
initramfs is updated and the kernel is running.
