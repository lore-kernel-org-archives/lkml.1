Thanks for the detailed explanation. Understand it.
But I still have another question about the function of
async_synchronize_cookie. I don't know whether my understanding is
correct or not.
The function of async_synchronize_cookie is realized by comparing the
variable of lowest_in_progress with the cookie. Only when the
lowest_in_process is greater than or equal to the cookie value, it will
return. When async_schedule is called, a new cookie will be assigned,
which can also be used as the second argument of
async_synchronize_cookie.

The value of lowest_in_progress is updated after calling the callback
function (async_func_ptr). But the async_synchronize_cookie is called in
the callback function (acpi_bus_register_async). 
In such case it seems that there exists the dead lock. The value of
lowest_in_progress should be updated before finishing the async callback
function. But the value of lowest_in_progress is updated after calling
the async callback function.
