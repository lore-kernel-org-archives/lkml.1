since this thread looks like it's going to get away from me in a
hurry :-), my only point in asking was to point out that that lone
module was the only thing preventing the build from being module-free.

i'm not saying that that's *necessarily* a good thing, but it just
strikes me as odd that, out of all of the possible modules that might
be selected in a default config for x86, this was the *only* one that
was picked.

i just think it's a bit weird, that's all.

rday

p.s.  it's mostly a case of -- whenever i notice something being done
only *once* in the entire source tree, i'm always a bit leery.
