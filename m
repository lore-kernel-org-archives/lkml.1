So at current rate of development and kernel release schedule, the best
possible scenario is still 6 months away - whereas this patchset is already 
tested and ready for merging now.

Out of tree patches don't work.  Nobody tests them.  A module parameter
will not work - we need to be able to expose the sysfs interface so that
users may chose to turn the feature off and on at will - mainly according
to their usage.  For example, at boot time - you want ALPM off to maximize
performance.  Lets say when you are plugged into the wall socket, you leave
it off, but then when you go on battery power you would want to enable it.

They thought we needed two because sometimes the device knows when it
will be idle faster than the host can. this is why ALPM can determine
idleness faster than any software algorithm on the host cpu can.  You
can use ALPM without having HIPM.  You can also use it without having 
DIPM.

"unnecessary" is subjective and at the moment, untrue.  You 
have to make performance/power tradeoffs with anything, whether it's 
CPU or your AHCI controller.  It's the current cost of getting out of these 
sleep states even if you aren't using ALPM but just doing HIPM or DIPM 
manually.  But, this is why it's so critical to allow the user to 
control when ALPM is enabled dynamically - which this patchset does.
The medium power setting is provided for users who wish to not go to
SLUMBER and get the higher latency cost but still have some power savings.

I understand you are being cautious based on your prior experience, but
again we still have no data to show that we are going to have a lot of
problems.  Perhaps we should proceed optimistically and deal with problems
when they actually occur rather than block something on a bet.

How about a patch? I'd love to have a flexible interface to userland,
it was my goal to provide this with the sysfs files.  The requirement
is that the users be able to turn ALPM off and on dynamically, and to
be able to chose the power savings level you want - i.e. SLUMBER vs.
PARTIAL - perferrably not using those terms since users really shouldn't
need to know AHCI terminology just to chose a power management level.
