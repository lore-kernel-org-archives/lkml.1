Sounds reasonable.

Well I have posted them all earlier.  At this point I it makes most
sense to wait until after the big merge happen and every rebases on
top of that.  Then everyone will have network namespace support and
it is easier to look through all of the patches.  Especially since
it looks like the merge window will open any day now.

I will quickly recap the essence of what I am looking at:
On directories of interest I tag all of their directory
entries with which namespace they belong to.  On a mount
of sysfs I remember which namespace we were in when we
mounted sysfs.  The I filter readdir and lookup based upon
the namespace I captured at mount time.  I do my best
to generalize it so that the logic can work for different
namespaces.

Currently the heart of the patch from the network namespace
is below (I sniped the part that does the capture at mount time).
Basically the interface to users of this functionality is just
providing some way to go from a super block or a kobject to
the tag sysfs is using to filter things.

So I get one sysfs_dirent tree, but each super_block has it's
own tree of dcache entries.

Everything else is pretty much details in checking and propagating
the tags into the appropriate places.
