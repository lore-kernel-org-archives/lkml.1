Could you double-check that this is reproduceable with this commit
applied, and not reproduceable when it's not?

I suppose it's not impossible that this could be triggering the problem
in some very roundabout way, but it seems a bit out of left field--so I
wonder whether one of the bisection points could have gotten marked good
when it should have been bad, or vice-versa.

I think commands like "ls" try to get posix acls these days, so it's
possible that the nfs3_proc_getacl code at least might be getting
called.  Why that would matter I can't see.
