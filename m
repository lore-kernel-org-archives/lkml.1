Then sure, use SCSI ... the ibmvscsi client originally talked to some
type of hypervisor interface too before IBM extracted it and open
sourced the server.  If actual SCSI commands are going in somewhere ...
be it a real device, a RAID firmware emulation or a hypervisor input,
then I'm happy with the driver being in SCSI.
