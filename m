Look in drivers/usb/storage::slave_configure

		/* Some devices report a SCSI revision level above 2 but are
		 * unable to handle the REPORT LUNS command (for which
		 * support is mandatory at level 3).  Since we already have
		 * a Get-Max-LUN request, we won't lose much by setting the

		if (sdev->scsi_level > SCSI_2)
			sdev->sdev_target->scsi_level =
					sdev->scsi_level = SCSI_2;

So the scsi_level is hard coded to very low.
Or am I reading this code wrong and it is only triggered for some but not
all devices?
