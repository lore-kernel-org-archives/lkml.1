Call it what you like,

Hmm, CFQ doesn't have any extra processing latency, especially 
"extremely", hence there is nothing to defeat. If it had, how could it 
been chosen as the default?

Subject:    [PATCH][RFC 13/23]: Export of alloc_io_context() function
From:       Vladislav Bolkhovitin <vst () vlnb ! net>
Date:       2008-12-10 18:49:19
Message-ID: 49400F2F.4050603 () vlnb ! net

This patch exports alloc_io_context() function. For performance reasons 
SCST queues commands using a pool of IO threads. It is considerably 
better for performance (>30% increase on sequential reads) if threads in 
  a pool have the same IO context. Since SCST can be built as a module, 
it needs alloc_io_context() function exported.

I call that lying.

I don't know what games your playing at, but do me a favor, if your too
stupid enough to realize when your caught in a lie and to just shut up
then please do me the favor and leave me out of any further correspondence
from you.

Thank you,
