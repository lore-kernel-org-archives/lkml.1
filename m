I completely agree, but that's "just" a usability issue. Ext4 will tell
you that barriers failed and are now disabled, not very informative. XFS
will tell you something similar.

We can do that, not a problem. The problem is that ordering is almost
never preserved, SCSI does not use ordered tags because it hasn't
verified that its error path doesn't reorder by mistake. So right now
you can basically use 'false' as that flag.

It's valid in the sense that it's the only RELIABLE primitive we have.
Are you really suggestion that we just assume any device is fully
ordered, unless proven otherwise?

As long as you do a trial barrier like XFS does, barriers will not fail
unless you have media error. Things would also be much easier, if writes
never failed.
