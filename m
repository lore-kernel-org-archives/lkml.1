Phase wise approach makes sense. I already have working patches for
following things.

1. PAM module for placement of tasks
2. Modification of init scripts and a tool "cgclassify" so that at boot up
   time "init" and other system services are moved to "admin"'s group.
3. libcgroup API so that application can use these to place forked children
   in right cgroup before doing exec.
4. A command line tool "execcg" which helps a user launch application in
   specific "cgroup".

5. A classification daemon (based on netlink as of today. Should move to
  cgroup fs based notification mechanism probably.)   

I think in phase1, we can get first 4 items merged and stablized and then
work on daemon in phase2 (if need be).

One issue with daemon was raised with respect to containers. It will
interfere with placement of container threads also and this is not
desired.

This will have to be worked out.

Thanks
