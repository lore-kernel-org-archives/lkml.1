Two issues i found: First, in subbuf_splice_actor the function pointer
spd_release is not initialized, but later, splice_to_pipe calls
	while (page_nr < spd_pages)
		spd->spd_release(spd, page_nr++);

I would guess that the function pointer should point to
spd_release_page or something similar.

The second one: It seems that the loop in splice_direct_to_actor first
calls do_splice_to to get the trace data into the pipe and then
actor, to move the data out to the network socket. With some debug
printks, i see that splice_to_pipe waits on the call pipe_wait(pipe)
until there is some free space again. But if the same process should
loop through the read and write parts, the pipe_wait would deadlock
the process, or am i missing something here?
