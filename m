Completely agree, don't waste time implementing something that nobody
will ever touch. The only reason to fiddle with such a setting would be
to increase it, because ios are too small. And even finding out that the
segment limit is the one killing you would take some insight and work
from the user.

Just make it Big Enough to cover most cases. 32 is definitely small, 256
entries would get you 1MB ios which I guess is more appropriate.
