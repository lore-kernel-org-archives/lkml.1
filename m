Although you picked a code segment out of the modern aic7xxx, there is a
matching similar one in aic7xxx_old.  Now, in all fairness, I was at one
point playing with a much more preemptable model for that driver that
allowed nested pauses, at which point the value of pause would have made
sense to be scalar, but that was a *long* time ago.

Hence the reason for the original upper case TRUE/FALSE.  I have to
admit, I don't really like the lower case true/false, it looks like a
variable that can be assigned, thereby changing the implementation of
the function call when in fact each calling location is hard coding a
constant.  But, that's just me and my crufty old C that differentiates
between hard coded things and variables via case.

Hehehe...and here I was thinking of factoring that thing into files and
actually bringing it into the current century.
