What we need is for the "filehandle" to be stable and unique.
By 'stable' I mean that every time I get the filehandle for a particular
file, I get the same string of bytes.
By 'uniqie' I mean that if I get two filehandles for two different
files, they must differ in at least one bit.
If a file is deleted and the inode is re-used for a new file, then the
old and new files are different and must have different file handles.

The filehandle is traditionally generated from the inode number and
a generation number, but the filesystem can actually do whatever it
likes.  xfs does it with xfs_fs_encode_fh().

Certainly you could initialise the i_generation to jiffies in
xfs_ialloc_ag_alloc.  That would be a suitable fix.  get_random_bytes
might be better, but the difference probably wouldn't be noticeable.
