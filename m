Jens, if I can re-create the 'fsync' times (I haven't yet), then the 
default scheduler _will_ be switched to AS.

I'm sorry, but that fsync thing _is_ a real-world case, and it's the one 
that a hell of a lot more people care about than some idiotic sqlite 
throughput issue.

You have a test-case now. Consider it a priority, or consider CFQ to be a 
"for crazy servers that only care about throughput".

Quite frankly, the fact that I can see _seconds_ of latencies with a 
really good SSD is not acceptable. The fact that it is by design is even 
less so.

Latency is more important than throughput. It's that simple.
