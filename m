hm, I'm uncertain on the desirability or otherwise of the overall feature.

Are there users or distros or device manufacturers asking for this? 
Where did the requirement come from?

What downstream application will handle the uevent messages?  Do you
have some userspace design/plan in mind?

IOW, it would be useful if we were told more about all of this, rather
than just staring at a kernel patch!

One part of the design which you didn't describe, but which I inferred
is that you intend that userspace will see the FS_UNCLEAN=1 messages
and will then poll all the /sys/block/<bdev>/<part>/fs_unclean files to
work out which partition(s) got the error, correct?  Please spell all
that out in the changelog.

What use is the FS_UNCLEAN=0 message?  I don't get that.  Again, please
cover this in the description.

The "unclean" term doesn't seem a good fit.  It usually means "has
in-memory data which needs writing back".  But here you've redefined
"unclean" to mean "got an IO error" or "detected metadata
inconsistency", or perhaps "dunno, please run fsck to find out".  This
all should be spelled out in exacting detail and thought about, please.
