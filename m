We are looking at 2 different use-cases i think.

for the power-user system manager, who manages all his servers and has 
knowledgeable backup, initrd may indeed work as above.

I have to keep in mind, that when there is a problem while i am 
travelling (and that happens), there is no sys-admin present. Also, i am 
supporting systems remote where no-one has the knowledge to debug using 
a initrd. In such cases, initrd is an additional step. And each 
additional step is an additional source of mistakes.

1/ distro tools assume that the kernel being build will run on that 
machine. For servers this is often not true. There are very valid 
security reasons to exclude compilation capability from many servers.
2/ For most small shops, there is need for RAID (disks are fallible, 
shop cannot do without server), the RAID should work without being 
visible. If there is a problem with the RAID that causes auto-assemble 
to break, it means i need to travel (>100KM) to trouble shoot. The 
simpler the setup, the more i like it. This is also why i almost always 
use HW raid for the system partitions. The ones i use have userland 
tools in Linux which warn on disk failure, ensure auto rebuild, etc...
Still, for large storage needs it is SW RAID over SATA.
3/ for my home systems, if i need to remote-support to get things 
working again (i am often travelling for my work), the added layer of 
initrd is an added layer of possible mistakes.
