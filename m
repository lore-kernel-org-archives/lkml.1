Yeah, stgt also enables you to use a software media changer and a
software DVD drive (and we are working on VTL).

You can connect to a remote host with iSCSI. FCoE might work since
Mike Christie has used stgt to work on the FCoE initiator driver.

stgt doesn't support non-512 byte sector sizes now but I'll add the
support shortly. I want to try DIF with iSCSI and FCoE.
