There are two cases for blk_queue_init_tags; one is for a shared tag map
and the other is for individual tag maps.  If you look at the code and
its use, blk_queue_resize_tags is *only* called for the individual tag
map case (or for the first caller in a shared tag map case).

The blk_queue_resize_tags() also returns -EBUSY on shared tag maps,
except the first one; which really exposes a bug in SCSI: we want to set
the shared tag map to some host specific depth and then carve off pieces
of it in the devices, so we don't want to adjust the queue down to
whatever the first seen device wants, and we don't want all other
devices to fail to adjust the scsi_queue depth the mid-layer uses.

This should fix up scsi.
