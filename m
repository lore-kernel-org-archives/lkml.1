Linus, please pull from

	git://lost.foo-projects.org/~dwillia2/git/iop ioat-md-accel-for-linus

to receive:

1/ I/OAT performance tweaks and simple fixups.  These patches have been
   in -mm for a few kernel releases as git-ioat.patch
2/ RAID5 acceleration and the async_tx api.  These patches have also
   been in -mm for a few kernel releases as git-md-accel.patch.  In
   addition, they have received field testing as a part of the -iop kernel
   released via SourceForge[1] since 2.6.18-rc6.

The raid acceleration work can further be subdivided into three logical
areas:
- API -
The async_tx api provides methods for describing a chain of
asynchronous bulk memory transfers/transforms with support for
inter-transactional dependencies.  It is implemented as a dmaengine
client that smooths over the details of different hardware offload
engine implementations.  Code that is written to the api can optimize
for asynchronous operation and the api will fit the chain of operations
to the available offload resources. 

- Implementation -
When the raid acceleration work was proposed, Neil laid out the
following attack plan:
    1/ move the xor and copy operations outside spin_lock(&sh->lock)
    2/ find/implement an asynchronous offload api
The raid5_run_ops routine uses the asynchronous offload api
(async_tx) and the stripe_operations member of a stripe_head to carry
out xor and copy operations asynchronously, outside the lock.

- Driver -
The Intel(R) Xscale IOP series of I/O processors integrate an Xscale
core with raid acceleration engines.  The iop-adma driver supports the
copy and xor capabilities of the 3 IOP architectures iop32x, iop33x, and
iop34x.

All the MD changes have been acked-by Neil Brown.  For the changes made
to net/ I have received David Miller's acked-by.  Shannon Nelson has
tested the I/OAT changes (due to async_tx support) in his environment
and has added his signed-off-by.  Herbert Xu has agreed to let the
async_tx api be housed under crypto/ with the intent to coordinate
efforts as support for transforms like crc32c and raid6-p+q are
developed.

To be clear Shannon Nelson is the I/OAT maintainer, but we agreed that I
should coordinate this release to simplify the merge process.  Going
forward I will be the iop-adma maintainer.  For the common bits,
dmaengine core and the async_tx api, Shannon and I will coordinate as
co-maintainers.

- Credits -
I cannot thank Neil Brown enough for his advice and patience as this
code was developed.

Jeff Garzik is credited with helping the dmaengine core and async_tx
become sane apis.  You are credited with the general premise that users
of an asynchronous offload engine api should not know or care if an
operation is carried out asynchronously or synchronously in software.
Andrew Morton is credited with corralling these conflicting git trees in
-mm and more importantly imparting encouragement at OLS 2006.

Per Andrew's request the md-accel changelogs were fleshed out and the
patch set was posted for a final review a few weeks ago[2].  To my
knowledge there are no pending review items.  This tree is based on
2.6.22.

Thank you,
Dan
