We discussed this idea when I rewrote the sense allocation code, I
think.

I like that idea that unifying scsi_cmnd and llds' per-commad
structure however there is one tricky thing about it.

Currently, a lld frees (or reuses) its per-commad structure when it
calls scsi_done(). SCSI-ml uses scsi_cmd after that so we need to
change the lifetime management (so we need to inspect all the llds,
e.g. this change will break iscsi ldd).

With that change, we can't tell llds how many per-commad structure are
possibly necessary. In general, LLDs want to know the maximum number
of per-commad structure; drivers allocates the number of per-commad
structure equal to host_template->can_queue.
