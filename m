I'm open to suggestions. Calling complete in cciss_remove_one does not
resolve the issue. Other things I've tried may work once or twice but always
results in the hang.
Something I noticed in the trace was 2 calls to rebuild_lun_table when
trying to rmmod. Then it would get into the scheduler and just hang. During
rmmod I don't want to call rebuild_lun_table, just kill the thread and exit.

Ideas, suggestions, flames? Anyone????
