Unfortunately, there are no more messages in the syslog than in the dmesg.

For the two fs the only inode which shows up is the inode 8 (this seems to
be the journal. According to 'stat <8>' in debugfs it looks like the journal is 134Megs long. I don't remember exactly how I created the fs, but i'm sure I did not specified the journal size. Does it seem reasonable for a 6,6G fs?

However seeing only the journal inode could be because I only had the last
300 blocks left in the dmesg. A small number of them did not belong to any
inode.

Should I reboot with a very big ring buffer?
