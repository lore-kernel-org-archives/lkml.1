I actually did that in the next patch, but I have been looking a bit
deeper into this and it might not be such a good idea. That, or there is
a bug in pci-dma_64.c.

In arch/x86/kernel/pci-dma_64.c , dma_alloc_coherent() adds
__GFP_NORETRY to the gfp flags before it calls __get_free_pages (through
dma_alloc_pages).

That means dma_alloc_coherent() -> __get_free_pages() can fail quite
easily on x86_64 with GFP_KERNEL.

If in __get_free_pages() try_to_free_pages() fails once, and
__GFP_NORETRY is set, there is .. well .. no retry :)

But why does dma_alloc_coherent() on x86_64 set __GFP_NORETRY ? It says
"don't invoke OOM killer" but I think it has more side affects than
that: easier failure.

Now I think I know why the 3ware management utility tw_cli crashes a lot
on my 64-bit boxes with a large diskwrite load ... I've fixed that now
by commenting out  gfp |= __GFP_NORETRY .

Note that pci-dma_32.c in 2.6.25 does not do this, but in 2.6.26-rc3 the
two have been merged and __GFP_NORETRY is set for x86_32 as well now. Is
that a good idea ? Perhaps a __GFP_NO_OOMKILL ?

Mike.
