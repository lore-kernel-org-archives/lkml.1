  I'm not quite following you. j_barrier_count is increased only in
journal_lock_updates(). Noone is forced to first call
journal_lock_updates() and only after that journal_flush() (although
usually it is done that way). So I think taking the j_checkpoint_mutex in
journal_flush() is really a good thing to do.
