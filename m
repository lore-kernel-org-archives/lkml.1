Do you mean multiple users sharing the same I/O address space (but
each user using a different segment), or multiple users, each with its
own I/O address space, but only using a specific segment of that
address space and using a single bitmap to represent free space in all
segments? If the former, then you are losing some of the benefit of
the IOMMU since all users can DMA to other users areas (same I/O
address space). If the latter, having a bitmap per IO address space
seems simpler and would have the same memory consumption.

Agreed, CPU utilization would be very interesting here.

Is there a public description of the caching policies of currently
available VT-d hardware?

Why not do what hash-tables implementation do, start small and resize
when we approach half-full?
