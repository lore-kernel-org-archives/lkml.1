The real issue here is the code path can not go to sleep. If simply 
replacing semaphore with mutex, the issue still happens. First of all we

need to have a lock system which doesn't allow the code go to sleep. We
are 
working on a new patch now.

But one step back, if without considering this sleeping issue, I agree
with 
you that mutex would be a better approach than semaphore.

>Hmm, then again, does ia64 have lockdep?

IA64 doesn't support lockdep yet.

Thanks.
