So, is it safe to say that the library routines for integrity-aware file
systems have not been tested at all?  Specifically, I'm talking about:
bio_integrity_tag_size
bio_integrity_set_tag
bio_integrity_get_tag

gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20071124 (Red Hat 4.1.2-41)

I did a new clone (just to be sure I got your change) and I get the same
problem.  I also can't see the changeset in the log, so are you sure you
pushed it?

I got rid of the inline in the definition in bio.h.  The .c file didn't
define the function as inline, so I didn't have to change it.  It seems
to be building now.

Cheers,

Jeff
