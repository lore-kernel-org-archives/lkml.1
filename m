Yes, this is a problem. Even storage experts are not too familiar with 
SCSI internals and not willing much to get better familiarity. Hence, 
almost nobody really understands for what is all those SCSI processing 
in SCST..

ISER is "iSCSI Extensions for RDMA", while usually under "hardware 
accelerated traditional iSCSI" people mean regular hardware iSCSI cards, 
like QLogic 4xxx. Hence, your sentence for most people, including 
myself, was incorrect and confusing.

I meant something different: interface between target drivers and SCSI 
target core. Here (seems) you are going to have big troubles when you 
try to add not-iSCSI transport, like FC, for instance.

SCST and iSCSI-SCST, basically, do the same things, except iSCSI MC/S 
and related, + something more, like 1-to-many pass-through and 
scst_user, which need a big chunks of code, correct? And they are 
together about 2 times smaller:

$ find core-iscsi/svn/trunk/target/target -type f -name "*.[ch]"|xargs wc
59764  163202 1625877 total

$ find core-iscsi/svn/trunk/target/include -type f -name "*.[ch]"|xargs
2981  9316 91930 total
=
62745      1717807

vs

$ find svn/trunk/scst -type f -name "*.[ch]"|xargs wc
28327  77878 734625 total

Or did I count incorrectly?

Sure, there optional things. But there are also requirements, which must 
be followed. So, this isn't about interested or not, this is about must 
do or don't do at all.

Nobody in the Linux kernel community is interested to have obsolete or 
unneeded for the current kernel version code in the kernel, so if you 
want LIO core be in the kernel, you will have to make a major cleanup.

Also, see the above LIO vs SCST size comparison. Is the additional code 
all about the obsolete/currently unneeded features?

What you did (passing reservation commands directly to devices and 
nothing more) will work only with a single initiator per device, where 
reservations in the majority of cases are not needed at all. With 
multiple initiators, as it is in clusters and where reservations are 
really needed, it will sooner or later lead to data corruption. See the 
referenced above message as well as the whole thread.
