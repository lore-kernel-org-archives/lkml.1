I really think that the expectation that all OS's (windows, mac, even your ipod) 
all teach you not to hot unplug a device with any file system. Users have an 
"eject" or "safe unload" in windows, your iPod tells you not to power off or 
disconnect, etc.

I don't object to making that general statement - "Don't hot unplug a device 
with an active file system or actively used raw device" - but would object to 
the overly general statement about ext3 not working on flash, RAID5 not working, 
etc...
