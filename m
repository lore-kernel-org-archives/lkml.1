Those don't require a reboot test to verify, and are far easier to rollback.

Also, they can (and SHOULD) be done on testbeds.  While the kind of screwup
where an initramfs decides to bite you hard, usually cannot (they tend to
happen when things already went horribly wrong).

Yeah, cute.  What happens when the initrd is not updated for whatever
reason?  That is a new failure mode that doesn't exist with 0.9 and kernel
autorun.

It boils down to whether failure modes new to 1.x without autorun are more
likely to happen than the failure modes that are specific to 0.9 with
autorun.

IME, the 0.9 ones are less likely to happen, and I have been through quite a
few incidents involving boot problems.  Experience told me that initrds are
far more prone to operator errors than the kernel autorun.  Debian's
*stable* initramfs creators have not screwed up on me yet, but I am well
aware that they could.

That can be either a good or bad thing depending on the situation, so I
would never use it to count for (or against) 1.x or 0.9.
