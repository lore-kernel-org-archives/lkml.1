I tend to agree.  Without delayed allocation, the in-memory i_size and
on-disk i_disksize normally match each other, since we do block
allocation at prepare_write/write_begin time, and the i_size update just
immedietly around that time. However, with delayed allocation, the in
memory i_size is being update around prepare_write/commit_write, but the
i_disksize won't updated until later writepage/writepages() time. The
window now gets much larger.

With writeback mode, since there is no ordering there, I think it's
possible the the inode dirty pages have been sync to disk and the inode
structure being pushed out of the memory due to memory pressure, before
the i_disksize update cached in jbd2 reach to disk. Perhaps that explain
the "truncation"?

Not sure if this still a issue with the delalloc on new ordered mode, I
guess as long as the inode is on jinode list, and that inode can't push
out of memeory due to memory pressure since jbd is referencing it, then
this seems couldn't happen...
