Never mind. The way this is supposed to work is that the transport is
shut down. The code used to delete the socket directly, but I
reorganized this code to just set the XPT_CLOSE bit and let the normal
close path handle it when it came back through to retry. I'm not sure
exactly what version of the code you have, but it may be that your
missing the code from the close path that does this, or it may just not
work. As a first shot, can you try this patch and tell me if the
messages go away?
