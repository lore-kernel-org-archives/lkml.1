It might be interesting to know whether the file that we returned to the
client with nlink 0 was the same that you later saw corruption on; maybe
adding a printk of the inode number there would help.

Googling around on that error message, a previous thread:

	http://marc.info/?t=107429333300004&r=1&w=4

seems to conclude it's a bug, but doesn't followup with a fix.  And I
don't see any mention of possible filesystem corruption.

Is NFSv4 involved here?  I wonder if something that might otherwise be
only a problem for the client could become a problem for the server if
it attempts to do further operations with an unlinked inode in a
compound operation that follows a lookup.
