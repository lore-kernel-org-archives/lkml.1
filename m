Is -mm less full now? I've seen you dropped your third patch bomb, so
maybe there is room now ..
I regenerated the kconfig patches. They fit on top of todays git but
they do have some rejects on 2.6.21-mm1. The rejects are trivial to fix,
but there are about 10 of them.

So when will be a good time to add the Kconfig patches to git390?
And do you prefer to let them rot^H^H^Hmature in -mm for a while before
they can go upstream?
