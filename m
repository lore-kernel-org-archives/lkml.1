OK, a backmerge it is.  Linus, could you please pull
git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs-2.6.git/ write_inode
or suggest a saner way to do that?

I've done backmerges of two points in mainline (trees that got merged
into mainline, actually) that created conflicts.  So at that point it's
(a) descendent of what's been pulled into NFS tree and (b) merges clean
with mainline.  All for two patches (at commit 716c28c..) ;-/

It's independent from the previous VFS pull; there's more stuff, hopefully
for later today, but the worst of the mess should be gone with that one.

Shortlog:
Al Viro (2):
      Merge commit 'e402746a945ceb9d0486a8e3d5917c9228fa4404' into write_inode
      Merge commit '07fec73625dc0db6f9aed68019918208a2ca53f5' into write_inode

Christoph Hellwig (2):
      make sure data is on disk before calling ->write_inode
      pass writeback_control to ->write_inode
