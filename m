Just to clarify this is only changes the directory entries format on
ext2/3/4 fs with 64k block size. But currently without kernel changes
ext2/3/4 does not support 64 block size.

The e2fsprogs needs to be changed to sync up with this change.

Ted has a paper a while back to show ext2 disk format 
http://web.mit.edu/tytso/www/linux/ext2intro.html

The Documentation/filesystems/ext2.txt doesn't have the ext2 format
documented. That document is out-dated need to be reviewed and cleaned
up.

Without the first patch in this series: ext2 large blocksize support
patches, it fails to mount a ext2 filesystem with 64k block size. 

[PATCH 1/2] ext2:  Support large blocksize up to PAGESIZE
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/1/361

So the old ext2/3/4 driver will not get access the directory entry with
64k block size format changes.
