I confirmed (using strace) that my cdparanoia also opens /dev/scd0 with
O_NONBLOCK.

After applying the patch below to cdparanoia, the problem goes away.

--- cdparanoia-3.10.0+debian/interface/scan_devices.c.orig	2008-05-16 06:25:24.000000000 +0200
+++ cdparanoia-3.10.0+debian/interface/scan_devices.c	2008-09-17 16:36:14.000000000 +0200
@@ -608,7 +608,7 @@
 
   if(specialized_device) {
     if(use_sgio)
-      i_fd=open(specialized_device,O_RDWR|O_NONBLOCK);
+      i_fd=open(specialized_device,O_RDONLY);
     else
       i_fd=open(specialized_device,O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK);
   }

Note that I had to change `O_RDWR' to `O_RDONLY', else you get the error -EROFS
(read only file system) when opening /dev/scd0 (music CDs are read-only).

As this patch actually modifies libcdparanoia, and not the plain cdparanoia
executable, it may have side effects on other applications...
