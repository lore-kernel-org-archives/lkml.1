Boy you guys make a mess of a nice email trail :(

This is not the first time we've hit this problem and presumably it won't
be the last time.

Could we do something like

#if (BITS_PER_LONG > 32) || defined(CONFIG_LBD)
#define sector_upper_32(sector) ((sector) >> 32)
#else
#define sector_upper_32(sector) (0)
#endif

and then cciss can do

-	c->Request.CDB[2]= start_blk >> 56;
+	c->Request.CDB[2]= sector_upper_32(start_blk) >> 24;

which will do the right thing.


- I think it's safer as a macro - if we make it an inline then the
  compiler might still try to evaluate the argument and will still warn

- we could do something like

  static inline sector_t sector_shifted_right_by(sector_t s, int distance)
  {
	<fancy code goes here>
  }

  But I think that won't be as generally useful as the very basic
  sector_upper_32().

- sector_upper_32() isn't a vey nice name, but it has clarity-of-purpose..
