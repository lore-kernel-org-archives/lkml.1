  Oops, forgotten about it. I'll write one. Do we have some standard place
where to document such interfaces? I could create some file in
Documentation/filesystems/ but that seems a bit superfluous...

  I use "generic netlink", which is in fact a layer built on top of
netlink. As far as I've read it's documentation, creating a message
argument by argument is the preferred way. As David writes, this way
we can add new arguments without worries about backward compatibility,
alignment issues or such things.

> It doesn't appear to be versioned.  Should it be?
  We don't need a version for future additions. Also each attribute sent
has its identifier (e.g. QUOTA_NL_A_CAUSED_ID) and userspace checks these
identifiers and unknown attributes are ignored. But in case we would like
to remove some attribute, versioning would be probably useful so that
userspace won't break silently... So I'll add it.

  No, we don't need it as I wrote above.

  I also find major/minor pair a bit old-fashioned. But the identifying it
by a mountpoint is problematic - quota does not care about namespaces and
such and so it works with superblocks. It's not trivial to get a mountpoint
from a superblock (and generally it's frown upon, isn't it?). Also if a
filesystem is mounted on several places, we have to pick one (OK, userspace
has to do this choice anyway when displaying the message but still...).

  I know there's something going on in this area but I don't know any
details. If somebody has some advice what should be passed into userspace
so that user/group can be idenitified, it is welcome.

  Probably yes. Added.

  Thanks for all your comments.
