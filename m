Details?...  In theory the sd driver can be attached at any time and
nothing should be relying on it being there when the inquiry scan
finishes, so if there's a bug it would be exposed by async scanning, not
really caused by it.

No, scsi_complete_async_scans() here.  There should be an
async_synchronize_full() in sd_remove.

None of this really got reviewed through the SCSI list, so I'll let
Arjan answer.

This one looks to be a mismerge between the async tree and the SCSI
tree.
