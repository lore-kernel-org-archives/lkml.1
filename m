Simply answer how many things in kernel have gone through such 
validation things and did absence of going through them change anything 
for them from the mainline acceptance POV? Has the mainline open-iscsi 
even ran through your tests? And so?

I have nothing against any artificial tests, but one shouldn't 
overestimate their value.

BTW, removing people from CC usually considered as a very impolite thing.
