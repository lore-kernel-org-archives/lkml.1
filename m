Unfortunately not - if you mount a file system with write cache enabled 
and see "barriers disabled" messages in /var/log/messages, this is 
exactly what happens.

File systems issue write barrier operations that in turn do cache 
flushes (ATA_FLUSH_EXT) commands or its SCSI  equivalent.

MD5 and MD6 do not pass these operations on currently and there is no 
other file system level mechanism that somehow bypasses the IO stack to 
invalidate or flush the cache.

Note that some devices have non-volatile write caches (specifically 
arrays or battery backed RAID cards) where this is not an issue.

I think that you are confused - barriers are implemented using cache 
flushes.
