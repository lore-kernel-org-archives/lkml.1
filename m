Aha, sounds like an excellent theory.

As I said, the machine hung hard while doing a bunch of writes to a USB
thumbdrive and a kernel compile on sda1.  It could be hardware, but I've
been using this laptop as my primary test box for several months and
it's been fairly reliable (as reliable as git-of-the-day is, pretty
much).

I'll run memtest86 and check SMART.

Note that it is running DMAR (the Intel VT-d iommu implementation), it
could be that a DMA got messed up -- since the logs didn't make it I
don't know if DMAR reported any DMA protection faults at the time of
failure.  The DMAR on this box has had some issues in the past which
seem to be fixed, but ...

Oh, all the data is well backed-up; this is a seriously bleeding-edge
box.

I've taken a complete image of /dev/sda1 and will be reinstalling it.
The image is from after the kernel remounted / RO.

I would like to get as close to root cause as possible.  I have a
filesystem image copied away and I'll be attempting to repro the
failure; this is a test system for a large deployment, so I don't want
any issues lurking. :)

Let me know what debug commands you'd like to run.  dumpe2fs output is
at http://web.hexapodia.org/~adi/tmp/dumpe2fs.out
