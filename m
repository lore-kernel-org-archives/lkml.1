  Well, as far as I've looked into the code, we already write the buffer
anyway. So far we just warned that we are writing non-uptodate buffer. So
in this regard, I don't think there's any difference with/without my patch.

  I've changed only the "superblock buffers". Those have the property that
we read that just once during mount (and if this fails, we won't try to
write them anyway), keep pointer to them and occasionally try to write
them. Also we shouldn't really have garbage in them - they can be !uptodate
only because underlying device was not able to write them... For most other
buffers, when we fail to read them, we just bail out and don't try marking
them dirty, so we don't issue warning for them.

  Agreed, I'll add some comment to the code.

  OK. I've thought about one more option - if buffer isn't uptodate, just
avoid marking it dirty and writing it. That has the advantage that if the
spotted error is real bad block, then we won't retry writing it which
usually takes non-trivial time. But at the same time it is a disadvantage
because in case there's a transient error writing super-block, we'd never
retry writing it. So I decided to keep the current behavior...
