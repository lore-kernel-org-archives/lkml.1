It also says:

'f'     00-1F   linux/ext2_fs.h

and yet include/linux.h has:

#define	FS_IOC_GETFLAGS			_IOR('f', 1, long)
#define	FS_IOC_SETFLAGS			_IOW('f', 2, long)

as generic vfs ioctls.  These ioctls started out as
EXT2_IOC_SETFLAGS/EXT2_IOC_GETFLAGS but they were generically useful,
other filesystems picked them up, and they were "elevated" to the vfs.

It would be a simple matter of changing the documentation, I think.

Looks like it's called "level" but it's probably a holdover, it doesn't
look like it's used.

I'm still not very comfortable with the timeout; if you un-freeze on a
timer, how do you know that the work for which you needed the fileystem
frozen is complete?  How would you know if your snapshot was good if
there's a possibility that the fs unfroze while it was being taken?
