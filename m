I really disagree.  This kind of virtualised drivers are pretty much
communication protocols, and not hardware.  As such, why design a new one?
If there's an infelicity in the ibmvscsi protocol, it makes sense to
design a new one.  But being different for the sake of being different
is just a way to generate a huge amount of make-work.
