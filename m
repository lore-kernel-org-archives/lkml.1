Sure.  The important bit comes when deciding which bits need to be
available when CONFIG_BLOCK isn't set.  Obviously, there is no SCSI
without block (while sg is a character device, not a block device,
it depends on the block infrastructure to the extent that you couldn't
use it without CONFIG_BLOCK).

While it's not impossible that someone could want the SCSI protocol
and opcodes, status codes, etc. for a different character device, that
seems unlikely.  The four opcodes defined in the header seem to be
pretty SCSI-specific and not useful to use on non-scsi devices.
SCSI_IOCTL_GET_PCI looks like it might possibly be useful on more than
just SCSI, but we have better ways (ie sysfs) of determining the same
information in a more general way.

So I think it's fair to put an #ifdef CONFIG_BLOCK right after the
_SCSI_SCSI_H define and close it right at the end of the file.
