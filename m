This is (hopefully!) the last draft set of patches which I hope to be
able to push to Linus shortly.

These patches fix an embarassing typo in
"allow-ext4-to-run-without-a-journal", fix up some documentation issues,
and adds a patch which fixes a oops-on-corrupted-filesystem issue.  We
also remove the "extents" mount option, since it was buggy if used on a
filesystem that did not have the extents feature enabled, and it was
largely superfluous; so the easiest fix was to remove the extents mount
option altogether.
