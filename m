Hi Linus, please pull from:

     git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/djbw/async_tx.git fixes

...to receive:

Dan Williams (4):
      ioat3: fix p-disabled q-continuation
      async_tx: expand async raid6 test to cover ioatdma corner case
      ioat2,3: put channel hardware in known state at init
      Merge branch 'ioat' into fixes

Guennadi Liakhovetski (1):
      sh: fix DMA driver's descriptor chaining and cookie assignment

Julia Lawall (2):
      drivers/dma: drop unnecesary memset
      drivers/dma: Correct use after free

Nicolas Ferre (1):
      dma: at_hdmac: correct incompatible type for argument 1 of 'spin_lock_bh'

1/ A shdma fix from Guennadi that has been pending for a while, but
finally acked by the original driver author.
2/ Some Coccinelle fixes from Julia.
3/ A typo fix in at_hdmac from Nicolas.
4/ Two ioatdma driver fixes, one for a kexec reboot regression reported
by Roland, and a descriptor processing error when performing raid
recovery on a 11 or 12-disk raid6 array.

All of these have been in -next for a week or so.  Maciej has also
recently acked them, but to preserve the commit-ids I did not rebase.

One note, this diffstat was created by hand via a test merge branch as
the one created by 'git request-pull' was:

     806 files changed, 13676 insertions(+), 6334 deletions(-)

Not sure where that came from, the 'fixes' branch was based on
2.6.32-rc6 while the ioat changes were based on 2.6.32.

    ioat2,3: put channel hardware in known state at init
    
    Put the ioat2 and ioat3 state machines in the halted state with all
    errors cleared.
    
    The ioat1 init path is not disturbed for stability, there are no
    reported ioat1 initiaization issues.

    ioat3: fix p-disabled q-continuation
    
    When continuing a pq calculation the driver needs 3 extra sources.  The
    driver can perform a 3 source calculation with a single descriptor, but
    needs an extended descriptor to process up to 8 sources in one
    operation.  However, in the p-disabled case only one extra source is
    needed.  When continuing a p-disabled operation there are occasions
    (i.e. 0 < src_cnt % 8 < 3) where the tail operation does not need an
    extended descriptor.  Properly account for this fact otherwise invalid
    'dmacount' values will be written to hardware usually causing the
    channel to halt with 'invalid descriptor' errors.

    sh: fix DMA driver's descriptor chaining and cookie assignment
    
    The SH DMA driver wrongly assigns negative cookies to transfer descriptors,
    also, its chaining of partial descriptors is broken. The latter problem is
    usually invisible, because maximum transfer size per chunk is 16M, but if you
    artificially set this limit lower, the driver fails. Since cookies are also
    used in chunk management, both these problems are fixed in one patch. As side
    effects a possible memory leak, when descriptors are prepared, but not
    submitted, and multiple races have also been fixed.
