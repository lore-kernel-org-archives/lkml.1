What is inaccurate about it?

That's what he's documenting.

Given how long experience with storage you claim, you should know that
MD RAID5 does not support barriers by now...

....and understand by now that statistics are irrelevant for design
problems.

Ouch and trying to silence people by telling them to fix the problem
instead of documenting it is not nice either.
