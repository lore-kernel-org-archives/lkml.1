So the nfsd stacks are all identical:

Presumably that's the msleep(10) in nfsd_vfs_write().

That wouldn't explain the same nfsd thread waiting for several seconds,
though.  Or was it just that that several seconds during which different
nfsd threads were stuck in D, not necessarily the same ones?

What does your /etc/exports file look like on the server, and what are
the mount options on the client?

You could try turning off that msleep() with no_wdelay, but it may not
help.

The more likely explanation is that you just switched to a more recent
distro where "sync" (as opposed to "async") is the option.  Depending on
workload, "async" may improve performance a great deal, at the expense
of possible data corruption on server reboot!

If you're doing a lot of writing and using NFSv2, then switching to
NFSv3 may give you performance close to the "async" performance without
the corruption worries.
