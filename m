Hey Jens and James, one thing I forgot to mention is that I could not
remember if I needed an extra bio_get in there. I thought I did not
because the caller is not touching the bio after the bio_endio calls
like is done with the blk/bio_map_user path. But I did that patch so
long ago I do not remember now.
