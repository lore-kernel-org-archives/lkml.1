  I'm sorry but why truncate to zero does not need it? If we assume that
IO completion can still happen while ext3_truncate() is running which is
what you're afraid of, then I don't see a big difference between truncate
to zero, truncate to i_disksize (which is from where you do fdatawrite) or
truncate to anything else.
  Also two other comments:
...

-       if (!err && extend_disksize && inode->i_size > ei->i_disksize)
-               ei->i_disksize = inode->i_size;
+       if (!ext3_should_guard_data(inode) && !err && extend_disksize)
+               maybe_update_disk_isize(inode, inode->i_size);
This is kind of confusing. extend_disksize is used only from ext3_getblk()
which is called only for directories so the first condition is always true
- and if it wasn't sometime in future, you'd have a hard time tracking why
i_disksize is not updated.  So I'd rather add something like
  WARN_ON(extend_disksize && ext3_should_guard_data(inode));
if you wish to keep the check.

  Also I think you can have races between direct IO writing to the file
(updating i_disksize) and your completion handler updating i_disksize -
direct IO plays tricks with i_disksize to truncate allocated blocks in case
of failed write... It's all nasty ;( Probably we should somehow set clear
rules about i_disksize updates and clean up the code to obey them.
Otherwise we'll be hunting nasty races another two years...
