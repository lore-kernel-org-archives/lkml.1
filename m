Hmm. Sadly, I doubt that really cuts down the suspect list very much. Most 
of what has been merged since 2.6.25 has been in -mm, so while I agree 
that it looks very similar, the fact that it was possibly already in 
-rc8-mm2 doesn't much _help_.

And in fact, those oopses in rc8-mm2 don't look _that_ similar. Those are 
a corrupt f_mapping structure, it looks like (ie it looks like either 
"struct address_space" or a "struct filp" rather than a "struct dentry").

What is interesting about Jiri's version of the bug is that he has another 
value for the corruption than you do: you had either all-ones, or a value 
that *looked* like possibly a single nybble got cleared.

Jiri, in contrast, has a value of 00f0000000000000. Which is a bit 
interesting in that it's again a *nybble* that looks corrupt, but it's a 
different one.

But assuming Jiri's two oopses are related (which is not entirely 
unlikely), and assuming that this is a SLUB bucket re-use, then it's quite 
likely that the reason that his -rc8-mm2 oops looks different just because 
it was yet _another_ allocation that was in the same bucket. If so, the 
most likely one is "struct filp", because it has the right size: for me a 
filp is in the 192-byte bucket, which is very close to the 208-byte bucket 
of dentry.

So I could imagine that some config option or other change just changed 
the sizes around so that the two types ended up in different buckets in 
rc8-mm2 and in 2.6.25-mm1 (ie neither the dentry nor the filp necessarily 
changed sizes, but the *corrupting* type perhaps did?)

What I find interesting is that at least for me, I have the SLAB bucket 
size for nf_conntrack_expect being 208 bytes. And the *biggest* merge by 
far after 2.6.25 so far has been networking (and conntrack in particular)

Is that a smoking gun? Not necessarily. But it *is* intriguing. But there 
are other possible clashes (the 192-byte bucket has several different 
suspects, and not all of them are in networking).1

Jiri and Davem added to the Cc.

Jiri - could you also confirm whether you are usign SLUB (which is not 
necessarily at all indicative of a SLUB bug itself - it's just that SLAB 
won't ever even merge different allocations of the same size into the same 
buckets, so if it's a cross-slab corruption, you'd simply never see it 
with SLAB).

And if you are, can you please enable SLUB_DEBUG, and add a "slub_debug" 
to your kernel command line to enable all the debugging? That would 
hopefully catch any obvious use-after-free corruption.

I'm just whistling in the dark here, but it does seem worth pursuing this 
approach. The VFS layer has not changed *at*all* since 2.6.25, so I 
seriously doubt it's a dentry or filp bug - I think the corruption is 
external. And while networking is certainly not the only suspect (the x86 
architecture changes are pretty extensive too), the allocation size thing 
certainly makes it intriguing.
