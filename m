Yeah, they are nearly same. map_single allocates only one DMA address
while sg_map does allocates a DMA address again and again.

Agreed.

The current Intel IOMMU scheme is a bit unbalanced. It invalidates the
translation table every time dma_unmap_* is called, but it does the
batching of the TLB flushes. But it's what the most of Linux's IOMMU
code does.

I think that only PARISC (and IA64, of course) IOMMUs do the batching
of invalidating the translation table entries.
