I expected SCHED_IDLE to be better than setting quantum to 1, because
max is quantum*4 if you aren't IDLE.  But that's not what happened.  I
just retested with all knobs set back to stock, fairness off, and
quantum set to 1 with everything running nice 0.  2.8 seconds avg :-/

Yup.

No cgroups here.

fairness=1 very definitely makes a very large difference.  All of those
cfq numbers were logged in back to back runs.

Yeah, I was there yesterday.  I speculated that that would hurt my
reader, but rearranging things didn't help one bit.  Playing with merge,
I managed to give dd ~7% more throughput, and injured poor reader even
more.  (problem analysis via hammer/axe not always most effective;)
