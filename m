Hi Andrew, 

Here are the patches in ext4-patch-queue that I think can be considered
to be merged to upstream. Please review.

All of the patches have been posted on ext4 mailinglist before. Some are
bug fixes, some are features, to summaries:
- make extents on by default in ext4dev
- nanosecond timestamp
- 64 bit inode versioning support
- remove 32k subdir limits
- journal  checksumming
- journal stats via procfs
- delayed allocation for ext4 writeback mode
- fallocate()

All the patches can be found at http://repo.or.cz/w/ext4-patch-queue.git
and have been tested(with fsx ,dbench, FFSB, iozone) on
x86,x86_64,ppc64, with extents and delayed allocation enabled

And the full series can be found at
http://repo.or.cz/w/ext4-patch-queue.git?a=blob;f=series;h=2f43431db28778ce8d2149bce7a51566a2d2517c;hb=56e27e20cf228b32f5162a76b3bad154d1d3b730

I will post the patches-in-good-shape (in 9 set of patches) to lkml in
the following emails, except for the bottom two feature:

*the fallocate() patches, which Amit just posted a few days ago and are
under review (hopefully we can reach a agreement on the interface and
the "modes" before 2.6.23-rc1 window closed).

*Another one is the delayed allocation patches in ext4 patch queue. Alex
mentioned in another email that he is working on another version of
delalloc that can handle block size < page size, and move some work to
vfs. So it's probably not very useful to post this version for people to
review.


So, here is the series file.
