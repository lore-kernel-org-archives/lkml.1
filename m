I looked into this a little further:

I'm pretty much convinced that the asm-ia64 version of per_cpu_offset()
is unused as ia64 doesn't have lockdep. I will send a patch to get rid
of it. The generic version might be used on mips, sh or arm with
CONFIG_SMP, as these architectures have lockdep. I did managed to
produce a compiler error on mips by removing the asm-generic version of
per_cpu_offset().
