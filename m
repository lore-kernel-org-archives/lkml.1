Yes that's what I want, and if you can not save some of it's complexity
by, for example, merging of scsi_io_context with the request structure you
already have at scst level, or save the double-chained-callbacks at the end,
then you've done something wrong.

Exactly, it's just a parameter at the call to blk_execute_nowait() with it's
own defines already. Nothing SCSI.

Easiest, as all users do is: If you already have your scst request or
command, or what ever you call it. So add a sense_buffer array embedded
there, end of story no allocation needed.

How can you be a scsi-target and return the proper errors upstream,
without digging into sense-buffer and error returns to produce the
correct report.

Again all this is not needed and should be dropped it is already done
by bio bouncing. All you need to do is add the pages to bios, chain when
full, and call blk_make_request.
