But you can't guarentee ordering without flushing the data out as well.
It all depends on the type of cache on the device, of course. If you
look at the ordinary sata/ide drive with write back caching, you can't
just issue the requests in order and pray that the drive cache will make
it to platter.

If you don't have write back caching, or if the cache is battery backed
and thus guarenteed to never be lost, maintaining order is naturally
enough.

Or if the drive can do ordered queued commands, you can relax the
flushing (again depending on the cache type, you may need to take
different paths).

If you carefully re-read that paragraph, then it just tells you that the
software implementation can deal with reordered completions. It doesn't
relax the rconstraints on ordering and integrity AT ALL.
