[ CCing relevant folks on thread as what does fairness mean is becoming
  interesting]

What is that certain level? Secondly what's the advantage of this?

I can see disadvantages though. So unless a group is really busy "up to
that certain level" it will not get fairness? I breaks the isolation
between groups.

I ran my simple dd test again with two ioband deviecs of weight 200
(ioband1) and 100 (ioband2)respectively. I launched four sequential dd
readers on ioband2 and and one sequential reader in ioband1.

Now if we are providing isolation between groups then ioband1 should get
double the bandwidth of ioband1. But that does not happen. Following is
the output of "dmsetup table" command.

This seems to be breaking the isolation between two groups. Now if there
is one bad group with lots of readers and writers of lower weight, it will
overwhelm a group of higher weight with 1-2 readers running or some random
readers running etc.

If there are lots of readers running in a group and then a small file
reader comes in a different group of higher prio, it will not get any
fairness and latency of file read will be very high. But one would expect
that groups will provide isolation and latency of small file reader will
not increase with number of readers in a low prio group.

I also ran your test of doing heavy IO in two groups. This time I am
running 4 dd threads in both the ioband devices. Following is the snapshot
of "dmsetup table" output.

Note, it took me more than 20 seconds (since I started the threds) to
reach close to desired fairness level. That's too long a duration. Again
random readers or small file readers are compeltely out of picture for
any kind of fairness or are not protected at all with dm-ioband
controller.

I think there are serious issues with the notion of fairness and what kind of
isolation dm-ioband provide between groups and it should be looked into.

Thanks
Vivek
