    [XFS] Fix xfs_ichgtime()s broken usage of I_SYNC
    
    The recent I_LOCK->I_SYNC changes mistakenly changed xfs_ichgtime to look
    at I_SYNC instead of I_LOCK. This was incorrect and prevents newly created
    inodes from moving to the dirty list. Change this to the correct check
    which is for I_NEW, not I_LOCK or I_SYNC so that behaviour is correct.

    Fix breakage caused by commit 831441862956fffa17b9801db37e6ea1650b0f69
    that did not introduce the necessary call to set_freezable() in

    [XFS] revert to double-buffering readdir
    
    The current readdir implementation deadlocks on a btree buffers locks
    because nfsd calls back into ->lookup from the filldir callback. The only
    short-term fix for this is to revert to the old inefficient
    double-buffering scheme.

    [XFS] Fix broken inode cluster setup.
    
    The radix tree based inode caches did away with the inode cluster hashes,
    replacing them with a bunch of masking and gang lookups on the radix tree.
    
    This masking got broken when moving the code to per-ag radix trees and
    indexing by agino # rather than straight inode number. The result is
    clustered inode writeback does not cluster and things can go extremely
    slowly when there are lots of inodes to write.
    
    Fix it up by comparing the agino # of the inode we just looked up to the
    index of the cluster we are looking for.

    [XFS] Fixed a few bugs in xfs_buf_associate_memory()
    
    - calculation of 'page_count' was incorrect as it did not
      consider the offset of 'mem' into the first page. The
      logic to bump 'page_count' didn't work if 'len' was <=
      PAGE_CACHE_SIZE (ie offset = 3k, len = 2k).
    - setting b_buffer_length to 'len' is incorrect if 'offset'
      is > 0. Set it to the total length of the buffer.
    - I suspect that passing a non-aligned address into
      mem_to_page() for the first page may have been causing
      issues - don't know but just tidy up that code anyway.

    [XFS] 971064 Various fixups for xfs_bulkstat().
    
    - sanity check for NULL user buffer in xfs_ioc_bulkstat[_compat]()
    - remove the special case for XFS_IOC_FSBULKSTAT with count == 1. This
      special case causes bulkstat to fail because the special case uses
      xfs_bulkstat_single() instead of xfs_bulkstat() and the two functions
      have different semantics.  xfs_bulkstat() will return the next inode
      after the one supplied while skipping internal inodes (ie quota inodes).
      xfs_bulkstate_single() will only lookup the inode supplied and return
      an error if it is an internal inode.
    - in xfs_bulkstat(), need to initialise 'lastino' to the inode supplied
      so in cases were we return without examining any inodes the scan wont
      restart back at zero.
    - sanity check for valid *ubcountp values. Cannot sanity check for valid
      ubuffer here because some users of xfs_bulkstat() don't supply a buffer.
    - checks against 'ubleft' (the space left in the user's buffer) should be
      against 'statstruct_size' which is the supplied minimum object size.
      The mixture of checks against statstruct_size and 0 was one of the
      reasons we were skipping inodes.
    - if the formatter function returns BULKSTAT_RV_NOTHING and an error and
      the error is not ENOENT or EINVAL then we need to abort the scan. ENOENT
      is for inodes that are no longer valid and we just skip them. EINVAL is
      returned if we try to lookup an internal inode so we skip them too. For
      a DMF scan if the inode and DMF attribute cannot fit into the space left
      in the user's buffer it would return ERANGE. We didn't handle this error
      and skipped the inode. We would continue to skip inodes until one fitted
      into the user's buffer or we completed the scan.
    - put back the recalculation of agino (that got removed with the last fix)
      at the end of the while loop. This is because the code at the start of
      the loop expects agino to be the last inode examined if it is non-zero.
    - if we found some inodes but then encountered an error, return success
      this time and the error next time. If the formatter aborted with ENOMEM
      we will now return this error but only if we couldn't read any inodes.
      Previously if we encountered ENOMEM without reading any inodes we
      returned a zero count and no error which falsely indicated the scan was
      complete.

    [XFS] Fix dbflush panic in xfs_qm_sync.
    
    The recent behaviour layer removal dropped the check for quotas that have
    been requested at mount time but have subsequently been turned off. This
    results in a panic when accessing m_quotainfo which has been freed.
    
    This patch adds the check originally made by xfs_qm_syncall() to
    xfs_qm_sync().
