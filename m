First... I consider myself quite competent in the os level, yet I did
not realize what flash does and what that means for data
integrity. That means we need some documentation, or maybe we should
refuse to mount those devices r/w or something.

Then to answer your question... ext2. You expect to run fsck after
unclean shutdown, and you expect to have to solve some problems with
it. So the way ext2 deals with the flash media actually matches what
the user expects. (*)

OTOH in ext3 case you expect consistent filesystem after unplug; and
you don't get that.

Again, ext2 handles that in a way user expects it.

At least I was teached "ext2 needs fsck after powerfail; ext3 can
handle powerfails just ok".

Yep, we should add journal to RAID; or at least write "Linux MD
*needs* an UPS" in big and bold letters. I'm trying to do the second
part.

(Attached is current version of the patch).

[If you'd prefer patch saying that MMC/USB flash/Linux MD arrays are
generaly unsafe to use without UPS/reliable connection/no kernel
bugs... then I may try to push that. I was not sure... maybe some
filesystem _can_ handle this kind of issues?]

(*) Ok, now... user expects to run fsck, but very advanced users may
not expect old data to be damaged. Certainly I was not advanced enough
user few months ago.

+Linux block-backed filesystems can only work correctly when several
+conditions are met in the block layer and below (disks, flash
+cards). Some of them are obvious ("data on media should not change
+randomly"), some are less so. Not all filesystems require all of these
+to be satisfied for safe operation.
+
+Write errors not allowed (NO-WRITE-ERRORS)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Writes to media never fail. Even if disk returns error condition
+during write, filesystems can't handle that correctly.
+
+	Fortunately writes failing are very uncommon on traditional 
+	spinning disks, as they have spare sectors they use when write
+	fails.
+
+Don't cause collateral damage on a failed write (NO-COLLATERALS)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+On some storage systems, failed write (for example due to power
+failure) kills data in adjacent (or maybe unrelated) sectors.
+
+Unfortunately, cheap USB/SD flash cards I've seen do have this bug,
+and are thus unsuitable for all filesystems I know.
+
+	An inherent problem with using flash as a normal block device
+	is that the flash erase size is bigger than most filesystem
+	sector sizes.  So when you request a write, it may erase and
+	rewrite some 64k, 128k, or even a couple megabytes on the
+	really _big_ ones.
+
+	If you lose power in the middle of that, filesystem won't
+	notice that data in the "sectors" _around_ the one your were
+	trying to write to got trashed.
+
+	MD RAID-4/5/6 in degraded mode has similar problem, stripes
+	behave similary to eraseblocks.
+
+
+Don't damage the old data on a powerfail (ATOMIC-WRITES-ON-POWERFAIL)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Either whole sector is correctly written or nothing is written during
+powerfail.
+
+	Because RAM tends to fail faster than rest of system during 
+	powerfail, special hw killing DMA transfers may be necessary;
+	otherwise, disks may write garbage during powerfail.
+	This may be quite common on generic PC machines.
+
+	Note that atomic write is very hard to guarantee for MD RAID-4/5/6,
+	because it needs to write both changed data, and parity, to 
+	different disks. (But it will only really show up in degraded mode).
+	UPS for RAID array should help.

 Journaling
-----------
-
-A journaling extension to the ext2 code has been developed by Stephen
-Tweedie.  It avoids the risks of metadata corruption and the need to
-wait for e2fsck to complete after a crash, without requiring a change
-to the on-disk ext2 layout.  In a nutshell, the journal is a regular
-file which stores whole metadata (and optionally data) blocks that have
-been modified, prior to writing them into the filesystem.  This means
-it is possible to add a journal to an existing ext2 filesystem without
-the need for data conversion.
-
-When changes to the filesystem (e.g. a file is renamed) they are stored in
-a transaction in the journal and can either be complete or incomplete at
-the time of a crash.  If a transaction is complete at the time of a crash
-(or in the normal case where the system does not crash), then any blocks
-in that transaction are guaranteed to represent a valid filesystem state,
-and are copied into the filesystem.  If a transaction is incomplete at
-the time of the crash, then there is no guarantee of consistency for
-the blocks in that transaction so they are discarded (which means any
-filesystem changes they represent are also lost).
