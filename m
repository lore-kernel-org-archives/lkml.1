The following series cleans up the broken scan_thread code,
allows triggering of the scan_thread via sysfs, dynamically
allocates the per device structure for each logical drive as needed
instead of all at once at driver init time, fixes a bug in
logical drive addressing (seen on MSA2012), and adds lunid,
raid_level, and usage_count attributes in sysfs for each
logical drive.

---

Andrew Patterson (3):
      cciss: Allow triggering of rescan of logical drive topology via sysfs entry
      cciss: Use one scan thread per controller and fix hang during rmmod
      cciss: Remove sysfs entries for logical drives on driver cleanup.

Stephen M. Cameron (17):
      cciss: Dynamically allocate the drive_info_struct for each logical drive.
      cciss: Add usage_count attribute to each logical drive in /sys
      cciss: Add a "raid_level" attribute to each logical drive in /sys
      cciss: fix some magic numbers in the raid-level decoding
      cciss: Add lunid attribute to each logical drive in /sys
      cciss: Don't check h->busy_initializing in cciss_open().
      cciss: Preserve all 8 bytes of LUN ID for logical drives.
      cciss: Silence noisy per-disk messages output by cciss_read_capacity
      cciss: Fix excessive gendisk freeing bug on driver unload.
      cciss: Fix usage_count check in rebuild_lun_table when triggered via sysfs.
      cciss: Clear all sysfs-exposed data for deleted logical drives.
      cciss: Handle special case for sysfs attributes of the first logical drive.
      cciss: Handle cases when cciss_add_disk fails.
      cciss: Handle failure of blk_init_queue gracefully in cciss_add_disk.
      cciss: Rearrange logical drive sysfs code to make the "changing a disk" path work.
      cciss: Dynamically allocate struct device for each logical drive as needed.
      cciss: Remove some unused code in rebuild_lun_table()
