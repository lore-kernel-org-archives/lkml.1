Doesn't that assume that there are new inodes that are being dirtied?
If you only have the same inodes being redirtied and never any new
ones, the problem still occurs, right?

I don't really consider NFS to be a special case here. It just happens
to be where we saw the problem originally. Some of its characteristics
might make it easier to hit this, but I'm not certain of that.
