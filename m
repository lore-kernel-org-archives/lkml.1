Not to derail the thread, but you were definitely seeing the same issues
with stock 2.6.30.4, right?  We had all sorts of corruption happening for
files served via NFS with 2.6.28 and 2.6.29, but everything was magically
fixed on 2.6.30 (though we needed a lot of fscking).  I never did track
down what change fixed it, since it took a while to reproduce.

Hmm.  I just noticed what seems to be a new occurrence of "deleted inode
referenced" on a box with 2.6.30.  We saw many when we first upgraded to
2.6.30 due to the corruption caused by 2.6.29, but those all occurred
within a day or so and were fsck'd.  I would have thought the backup
sweeps would have tripped over that inode way before now...

Just wondering if you can confirm that the errors you saw with 2.6.30.4
were not leftover from older kernels.

Cheers,

Simon-
