Here's the fix to the tick_handle_periodic() tripping into an infinite
loop. Again, this was only triggered because the divide error that
caused jiffies to be skewed enough that the clock-steering code
increased the ns per jiffy conversion value enough that any slack we had
in the loop before was lost.

Fixing the divide issue avoids the problem (and is pretty important to
get upstream), but the underlying issue that we allow ONESHOT clockevent
mode to be used while the jiffies clocksource is in use is a concern.

Thomas had pointed out that ppc and other arches that do not have
PERIODIC mode clockevents don't trip over this, but I believe this has
been just luck so far, as we do not enable clocksource switching till
bootup is almost finished (to avoid clocksource churn), so after
interrupts are enabled, but before clocksource switching is allowed,
there is a chance (albeit very very small) that clock steering could
cause a similar problem on other arches.

Thomas, what do you think about this? With it s390 runs fine even
without the do_div() fix.

thanks

The following patch avoids and endless loop issue by requiring that a
highres valid clocksource be installed before we call tick_periodic() in
a loop when using ONESHOT mode. The result is we will only increment
jiffies once per interrupt until a continuous hardware clocksource is
available.

Without this, we can run into a endless loop, where each cycle through
the loop, jiffies is updated which increments time by tick_period or
more (due to clock steering), which can cause the event programming to
think the next event was before the newly incremented time and fail
causing tick_periodic() to be called again and the whole process loops
forever.
