Hmm, command for tracehook_signal_handler say this for stepping:
@stepping:           nonzero if debugger single-step or block-step in
use

So we have been lucky so far.

Ok, so with the full utrace the semantics of tracehook_signal_handler
is more than just causing a SIGTRAP. It is an indication for a signal
AND a SIGTRAP if single-stepping is active. To make both cases work we
should stop setting TIF_SINGLE_STEP in do_signal and pass
current->thread.per_info.single_step to tracehook_signal_handler
instead of test_thread_flag(TIF_SINGLE_STEP).
