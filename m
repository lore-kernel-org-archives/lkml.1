Yes, I bisected it with about the same config (as much as possible
with changing Kconfig),
LOCKDEP was enabled for all bisected configs.

Yes, I use SLUB.

Hm, I cannot forecast the time when I will have this message, I
gathered readprofile statistics

Could it be useful? I am afraid it is not.
I can try to gather it for lesser time around the event.

I did not mentioned a message from e1000 right after the lockdep message:
e1000: eth0: e1000_clean_tx_irq: Detected Tx Unit Hang
  Tx Queue             <0>
  TDH                  <8f>
  TDT                  <8f>
  next_to_use          <8f>
  next_to_clean        <44>
buffer_info[next_to_clean]
  time_stamp           <601d>
  next_to_watch        <44>
  jiffies              <647c>
  next_to_watch.status <1>

Perhaps, it is actually the reason for nfsd being stalled ?

I have tried the test without lockdep and it seems it does not stall.
But I am not pretty sure, it is harder to caught hanging without
lockdep message.

I found it in 2.6.26-rc1, I think it does not need to search after rc1.
