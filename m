Hello, I've finally able to reproduce the issue. I'm agree with your
diagnose. But while looking in to code i've found some questions
see late in the message.

Seems what this is not enough.
Just imagine, we may have following call-trace:

 userspace pwrite(fd, d, 1000, off)
 ->ext4_da_reserve_space(inode, 1000)
   ->dq_reserve_space(1000 + md_needed)
 userspace ftruncate(fd, off) /* "off"  is the same as in pwrite call */
 ->ext4_da_invalidatepage()
   ->ext4_da_page_release_reservation()
    ->ext4_da_release_space()
<<< And we decrease ->i_allocated_meta_blocks only if (mdb_free > 0)
 userspace close(fd)
So reserved metadata blocks will leak. I'm able to reproduce it like this:
 quotacheck -cu /mnt
 quotaon /mnt
 fsstres -p 16 -d /mnt -l999999999 -n99999999&
 sleep 180
 killall -9 fsstress
 sync; sync;
 cp /mnt/aquota.user > q1
 quotaoff /mnt
 quotacheck -cu /mnt/ # recaculate real quota usage.
 cp /mnt/aquota.user > q2
 diff -up q1 q2 # in my case i've found 1 block leaked.

IMHO we may drop i_allocated_meta_block in ext4_release_file()
But while looking in to this function i've found another question
about locking
static int ext4_release_file(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp)
{
	if (EXT4_I(inode)->i_state & EXT4_STATE_DA_ALLOC_CLOSE) {
		ext4_alloc_da_blocks(inode);
		EXT4_I(inode)->i_state &= ~EXT4_STATE_DA_ALLOC_CLOSE;
<<< Seems what i_state modification must being protected by i_mutex,
 but currently caller don't have to hold it.
.....                
	}
