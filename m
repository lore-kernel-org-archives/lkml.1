We are looking at two breakages:

1) the hang which is observed on AIC7xxx, which is identified (Ingo
tracked it down to a bunch of commits). There is a tentative fix right
now, which needs more testing and the ack of James. James has some
objections which stalled the fix, but I did not come around to dig
into this yet as I'm busy with #2.

2) a crash caused by blk_rq_map_sg() using more sg entries than the
code which setup the request estimated. That one is dangerous, it
already trashed a complete filesystem. I'm in the process of providing
the necessary debug data, as I found a way to reproduce the problem
halfsways.

Thanks,
