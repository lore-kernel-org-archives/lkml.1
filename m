  Thanks for letting me know. Attached is a rediff against current
Linus's tree.

Subject: [PATCH] ext3: Avoid starting a transaction in writepage when not necessary

This does the same as commit 9e80d407736161d9b8b0c5a0d44f786e44c322ea
(avoid starting a transaction when no block allocation is needed)
but for data=writeback mode of ext3. We also cleanup the data=ordered
case a bit to stick to coding style...
