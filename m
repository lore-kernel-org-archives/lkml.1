If we consider the basic (and mosted used) file system IO path, then
those 'M' sectors will usually be submitted in units that are smaller
than 'N' anyway. It would be silly to allocate a bio for 'N' sectors
(those get big), only to split it up again shortly.

The point is not to build it too big to begin with, and keep the
splitting as the slow path. That's how it was originally designed, and
it'll surely stay that way. Doing the split handling in generic code is
a good idea, it definitely should be. But I'm never going to make
splitting a normal part of IO operations just because we allow
arbitrarily large bios, sorry but that's insane.

Agree on that, we can make that generic (and should).

But this I still think is crazy, sorry.

What kind of answer is that?

Only if you need to split the same original bio twice on the same IO
path.
