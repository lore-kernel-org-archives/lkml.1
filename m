Well, my machine is based on Athlon 64 X2 with an ATI chipset.

The only two common things it has with your machine is probably that we both use
64-bit kernels and wireless adapters (different ones, for that matter).

I do use NetworkManager, BTW.

Well, one thing that suspend does and which is not done routinely is CPU
hotplugging.  Could you please check if you are able to provoke the symptoms
to appear by offlining-onlining CPU1?

Thanks,
Rafael
