I am using purely cgroup based interface. This makes life easier for user
space tools and libraries like libcgroup and should also help libvirt. Now
they can treat all the resource controllers in kernel in a uniform way
(through cgroup interface).

With-in cgroups, there are controller specific files and libcgroup is
aware of that. So libcgroup can be modified to take care of special
syntax of io.policy file. But this is not too big a deviation in overall
picture.

dm-ioband is coming up with a whole new way of configuring and managing
groups and now these user space tools shall have to be modified to take
care of this new way only for io controller.

The point is there is no need. You seem to be introducing this new
interface because you want to use this module with RHEL5 which does not
have cgroup support. 

I think this is hard to sell argument that upstream should also introduce
a new interface just because one wants to use the module with older
releases of kernel which did not have cgroup support.

Taking this new interface solves your case but will make life harder for user
space tools, libraries and applications making use of cgroups and various
resource controllers.

dm-ioband also supports cgroup but there is additional step required and
that is passing all the cgroup ids to various ioband devices. This
requires knowledge of all the ioband devices and how these have been
created and usage of dm tools. 

The only place where it helps a bit is that once the configuration is
done, one can move the tasks in groups to arbitrarily group them instead
of grouping these on pid, gid etc....

So it still does not solve the issue of dm-ioband being so different from
rest of the controllers and introducing a new interface for creation and
management of groups.

It is not bad if there is a proper justification for new interface and why
existing standard mechanism does not meet that requirement.

In this case you are saying that in general cgroup mechanism is sufficient
to take care of grouping of tasks but it is not available in older kernels
hence let us introduce a new interface in upstream kernels. I think this does
not work. This brings in unnecessary overhead of maintaining anohter interface
for upstream and upstream does not benefit from this interface.
