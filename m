Even if the filesystem has already been frozen, the superblock
should be returned. Because a caller should recognize the success of
freeze_bdev() and call thaw_bdev() to decrease the reference count. 
But I will remove drop_super() as it should be called in thaw_bdev().

In the original implementation,
unmount is protected by s_umount(semaphore),
not bd_mount_sem.  So, unmount task waits for unfreeze.
I think this original behavior shouldn't be changed, 
so the existing s_umount lock is better.

As you said, we should use the mutex.
I will replace it.

I will remove these comments.

I will fix the comment as :
" If a blockdevice-backed filesystem isn't specified, return."

Cheers, Takashi
