Yes, truth is dangerous. To vendors selling crap products.

Accurate as in 'has 0 information content' :-(.

It is also completely irrelevant.

Most people would be surprised that press of reset button is 'failure'
in this context.

It does not happen on inexpensive DISK parts,  so people do not expect
that and it is worth pointing out.
