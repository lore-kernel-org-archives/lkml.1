actually, you don't know if your USB key works that way or not. Pavel has 
ssome that do, that doesn't mean that all flash drives do

when you do a write to a flash drive you have to do the following items

1. allocate an empty eraseblock to put the data on

2. read the old eraseblock

3. merge the incoming write to the eraseblock

4. write the updated data to the flash

5. update the flash trnslation layer to point reads at the new location 
instead of the old location.

now if the flash drive does things in this order you will not loose any 
previously written data.

if the flash drive does step 5 before it does step 4, then you have a 
window where a crash can loose data (and no btrfs won't survive any better 
to have a large chunk of data just disappear)

it's possible that some super-cheap flash drives skip having a flash 
translation layer entirely, on those the process would be

1. read the old data into ram

2. merge the new write into the data in ram

3. erase the old data

4. write the new data

this obviously has a significant data loss window.

but if the device doesn't have a flash translation layer, then repeated 
writes to any one sector will kill the drive fairly quickly. (updates to 
the FAT would kill the sectors the FAT, journal, root directory, or 
superblock lives in due to the fact that every change to the disk requires 
an update to this file for example)

I think an update to the documentation is a good thing (especially after 
learning that a raid 6 array that has lost a single disk can still be 
corrupted during a powerfail situation), but I also agree that Pavel's 
wording is not detailed enough

I thought that that assumption was in the VFS layer, not in any particular 
filesystem
