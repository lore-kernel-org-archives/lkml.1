It is actually ok if the highly contention mutexes don't degrade as long
as they are highly contended and the holder isn't likely to schedule.

Sorry, I don't have stats on that.

Unfortunately, the need_resched() checks deal with a few of the ugly
corners.  They are more important without the waiter list check.
Basically if we spun without the need_resched() checks, the process who
wants to unlock might not be able to schedule back in.
