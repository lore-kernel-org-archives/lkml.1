If the device has 64KB boundary restriction, the device also has
max_seg_size restriction of 64KB or under. So the vmerge acounting
works (though we need to fix it to handle max_seg_size, as discussed).

What is your new restriction?

All restrictions that IOMMUs need to know are dma_get_seg_boundary and
dma_get_max_seg_size.
