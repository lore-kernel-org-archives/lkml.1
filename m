Hi Mark,

During a normal kexec (not kdump) adapter reset should not have taken
place at all. device_shutdown() routines should have taken care to
bring the device to a known sane state in first kernel so that second
kernel can initialize it without doing a reset.

With reset patch, now reset triggers on every kexec. Previously
that was not the case with kexec and adapter used to come up. I think
this needs to be looked into.

Thanks
Vivek
