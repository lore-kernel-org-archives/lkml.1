Well, are there interested, motivated, skilled developers with time?  :)

Otherwise it's a moot point.

That was sarcasm :)

libsas is a big 'ole pain, that I'm finding has many aic94xx-isms buried 
in the lib.

That's sorta the way I read the hardware docs, too.

I have some engineering questions pending with Broadcom, but from my 
read, SMP and STP don't seem supported.

Yep.  The hardware (on my end of the spectrum) seems to be moving 
towards forcing software to generate all "packets," except (a) data 
frames [generated via DMA engine] or (b) special frames that need to 
modify the software-generate frame.

Nomemclature came straight from the hardware docs, I'm afraid.

Comparing with the Marvell hardware, I can see how (with Marvell) wide 
ports can be set up, and the port/phy distinction is easily programmable 
depending on the situation.

Not so with BCM8603.

The only places where the docs mention SMP and STP at all is in the SAS 
outgoing DMA descriptor docs, when you fill in connection type.  The 
_only_ other mention of SMP or STP at all is a note saying neither is 
supported.  So, even the docs contradict themselves, but overall I have 
the feeling that SMP/STP are out of my hands.

I wonder if Broadcom's interface is born out of the closed RAID-on-chip 
product that this is descended from.

Hopefully more knowledge will be gained soon, as I debug simple SAS and 
SATA device plug/unplug, and ask Broadcom questions.

Same response as at the top :)  Marvell is actually better at responding 
than Broadcom, but I'm quite reluctant to make /another/ introduction 
(already did so for one hacker) that leads nowhere.
