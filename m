No problems to report yet, working well, I wish I had multiple x4 or x16 
slots and use those instead of x1 cards (the mobo would need to support 
the I/O as well)..

I read remeber 'locked' 64kb read problem but not any corruption issue.

Also I MD5SUM -c (verify) 100-150GiB of data daily or so to make sure it 
is OK, so far, no problems.

Have not seen it yet.

Yes, I asked Supermicro about it and they never mailed me back about a 
PCIe version..

That's a good question, I suppose if it was easy it would have already 
been done?
