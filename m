q write to raid 5 doesn't need to write to all drives, but it does need to 
write to two drives (the drive you are modifying and the parity drive)

if you are not degraded and only suceed on one write you will detect the 
corruption later when you try to verify the data.

if you are degraded and only suceed on one write, then the entire stripe 
gets corrupted.

but this is a double failure (one drive + unclean shutdown)

if you have battery-backed cache you will finish the writes when you 
reboot.

if you don't have battery-backed cache (or are using software raid and 
crashed in the middle of sending the writes to the drive) you loose, but 
unless you disable write buffers and do sync writes (which nobody is going 
to do because of the performance problems) you will loose data in an 
unclean shutdown anyway.
