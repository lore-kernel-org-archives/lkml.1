It's OK as merge resolution, but I really wonder if that patch (taking
quota initialization to filesystems) is a good idea.  It adds boilerplate
code that is easy to miss.  And looking at what's done in e.g. ext2,
I'd say that places where it's added are lousy - if we want to do that
on directory modifications, we ought to take it into places that actually
create directory entries.  Not to mention that we never shrink directories
there, so it should be just one call in ext2_add_link() instead of all
that pile.

Looks like a good case for a followup series, if nothing else.
