Sorry to disappoint ... but I'm not an expert on cross compilation (I
run all my builds natively) or on the Intel compiler (I just use gcc).

I don't see any code like this near line 1750 of fs/ext3/super.c so
I guess the offending lines have been moved up or down by recent
changes.

Either option seems OK to me. char is signed on Itanium, so
the Intel compiler doesn't need to provide __CHAR_UNSIGNED__.

The Linux kernel doesn't benefit hugely from being compiled by the
Intel compiler ... there just aren't that many loops that run
for many iterations, no floating point code, and little else that
can benefit.  I challenge the "aeons to compile" claim too.  Most
of the config files I build take about 2 minutes each (and this is
on a basic 4-socket machine ... not on a giant SGI box). Not
great by the "5 seconds to build" that Linus mentioned at KS,
but hardly "aeons".

"char" defaults to signed on Itanium (so in this respect at least it is
a "sane" architecture :-)

This is incorrect.  K&R (first edition, (c) 1978) says (p. 183):
 "6.1 Characters and integers
	...
  Whether or not sign-extension occurs for characters is machine
  dependent, but it is guaranteed that a member of the standard
  character set is non-negative.  Of the machines treated by this
  manual, only the PDP-11 sign-extends."
