Hello,
  So I wonder: the sysfs tagged directory support patch is in GerKH
tree for more than a month.
I cloned today latest Linus tree (2.6.27-rc9) and
it is not there as far as I can see.
It is also not in linux-next tree (from september).
Now, I wonder what is the process of merging this
GregKH tree ? should I watch the LKML list for a pull request
from GregKH? or will it be first merged into the linux-next tree?

Regards,
Mark
