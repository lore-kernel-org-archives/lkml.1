  Here you update result whenever retry is < 0 and below when result == 0.
I think it's better to have these two consistent (not that it would be
currently any functional difference).

  OK, so this way you've basically serialized all users of
log_do_checkpoint(). That should be fine because performance-wise interesting
is only log_wait_for_space() and that was already serialized before. So
this change is fine with me. Only please add a comment in front of
log_do_checkpoint() that it's supposed to be called with j_checkpoint_mutex
held so that EIO propagation works correctly.
