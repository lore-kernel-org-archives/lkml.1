I still don't think that you can ever do mmap _and_ readdir on the same 
inode, so there's something wrong with the lockdep annotations.

See my earlier mail about putting directory inodes in a different class 
from non-directory inodes, and the email after that that points out that 
we already do:

 - inode_init_always():
	lockdep_set_class(&inode->i_mutex, &sb->s_type->i_mutex_key);

 - unlock_new_inode() (for directories):
	lockdep_set_class(&inode->i_mutex, &type->i_mutex_dir_key);

and I suspect that the reason why NFS triggers lockdep problems is that 
NFS probably plays some game with inodes (presumably the root inode) that 
ends up bypassing the normal new-inode handling.

In short - I really don't think this issue merits VFS-level (or VM, 
whatever you want to call it) hooks. There's a bug there, but I don't 
think you're actually fixing the right thing.

And _especially_ not the way you did it, where the filesystem can wrap the 
whole complex do_mmap_pgoff. The NFS use you have doesn't seem too bad, 
but anybody who tries to be clever and avoid "generic_mmap_do_pgoff()" 
would immediately be a major disaster.
