I notice Jiri, in your hardware list, you have an ath5k Atheros AR5212 chip
in there.

I took a look at the resume code for ath5k but nothing really suspicious
there except:

	err = pci_enable_device(pdev);
	if (err)
		return err;

	pci_restore_state(pdev);

Shouldn't we restore state before we turn the chip back on and thus
potentially let it start DMA'ing all over the place?
