Not for me they're not.  We worked hard to unify exposed ABIs for
drivers, so this is the most important user visible feature.  We can
clean up code in the drivers tree, that's easy.  We can't break the user
visible ABI of a supported driver without causing a lot of pain to its
user community.

The answer was in the email fragment you quoted: none on its own.  It
plugs into the standard FC transport ABI now.

However, there are various storage bodies who see creating user ABIs as
part of their job.  The way these tend to get implemented is in the
driver because that's the way it was done in UNIX (each driver rolls its
own).  Part of my job is going through drivers and taking them out
again ... while ensuring we at least have a way to perform whatever task
it was in a uniform manner for all drivers.

It is: it's implemented in the FC transport class, where it's uniform
for all FC drivers.
