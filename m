  Well, but by the time log_wait_commit() finishes, it may well
happen that a new transaction is already started so your lock doesn't
help you much. And the page you are called on is actually locked, so
noone can really mess with it until you unlock it... So I think you can
just use the lock for obtaining tid and then drop it.

PS: For JBD2 you'd need to be a bit more careful because you cannot call
log_wait_commit() while holding page lock (we have reversed locking
order for ext4) - but ordered-mode rewrite patch actually fixes this
problem and I'm going to submit the splitted patches on Monday or
Tuesday (I only need to test them that I didn't do something stupid
while porting them to ext4)...
