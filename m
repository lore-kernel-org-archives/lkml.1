There are 11 current (well, as of the 1.1 standard) SMP frame responses.
Each of them is actually a different length.  This driver treats SMP
frame response underruns as errors, so the fix you propose would cause
the whole discovery process to collapse.

We're not storing anything.  We're allocating a byte area for the driver
to deposit a response frame, we know we just sent a SMP DISCOVER
request, so we'd better get a discover response back (and the driver
will error on underrun or overrun, so we know if it returns successfully
that's exatly what we have).  The struct smp_resp contains the SMP
invariant header and then a union of all the other response data types,
so as long as we use either the header or the disc piece of the union,
there's no possibility of error, is there?
