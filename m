OK, here's a patch which I think should avoid the BUG in
fs/ext4/inode.c.  It should fix the regression, but in the long run we
need to pretty seriously rethink how we account for the need for
potentially new meta-data blocks when doing delayed allocation.

The remaining problem with this machinery is that
ext4_da_update_reserve_space() and ext4_da_release_space() is that
they both try to calculate how many metadata blocks will potentially
required by calculating ext4_calc_metadata_amount() based on the
number of delayed allocation blocks found in i_reserved_data_blocks.
The problem is that ext4_calc_metadata_amount() assumes that the
number of blocks passed to it is contiguous, and what might be left
remaining to be written in the page cache could be anything but
contiguous.  This is a problem which has always been there, so it's
not a regression per se; just a design flaw.

The patch below should fixes the regression caused by commit d21cd8f,
but we need to look much more closely to find a better way of
accounting for the potential need for metadata for inodes facing
delayed allocation.  Could people who are having problems with the BUG
in line 1063 of fs/ext4/inode.c try this patch?

Thanks!!

commit 48b71e562ecd35ab12f6b6420a92fb3c9145da92
Author: Theodore Ts'o <tytso@mit.edu>

    ext4: Patch up how we claim metadata blocks for quota purposes
    
    Commit d21cd8f triggered a BUG in the function
    ext4_da_update_reserve_space() found in fs/ext4/inode.c, which was
    caused by fact that ext4_calc_metadata_amount() can over-estimate how
    many metadata blocks will be needed, especially when using direct
    block-mapped files.  Work around this by not claiming any excess
    metadata blocks than we are prepared to claim at this point.
