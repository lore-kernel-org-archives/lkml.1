Actually, I don't think it's a smaller I/O issue.  The SMART protocol
specifically mandates that the transfers for SMART READ DATA and SMART
READ LOG shall be 512 bytes).  However, the pio transfer routine does
seem to be assuming sector alignment as well, which will be where your
problems are coming from.  I think we need to specify sector minimum
alignment for ata (but not atapi, which has its own non sector size pio
routine).  How about the attached?

We have to do this for all ATA devices, because they'll likely all
support SMART, and SMART is defined to be a PIO command.
