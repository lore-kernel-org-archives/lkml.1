No, it doesn't work like that.  As I wrote before, those partial
transfers are returned to the issuer as partial _SUCCESS_ not partial
failure.  ie. it's successful request w/ positive residual count not
the other way around.  The error is communicated to the issuer when
the leftover is re-issued.  There's no such thing as partial failure.

Please consider write failing after successfully writing certain
number of bytes.  A failed write command MUST NOT cause any actual
write on the device.

Residual count is not about how many bytes have been transferred.  The
number of transferred bytes itself doesn't mean a thing because it
changes depending on which transfer protocol is used regardless of
where the actual failure is.  Residual count is about how many bytes
have been actually produced or consumed and when a command fails none
should have been.

No it's not about being good or bad.  It's about being plain
undefined.  There is no value in setting an inherently undefined value
to certain values in certain corner cases.

If the upper layer might crash if the value is negative, I think it's
quite understandable to call negative values to be undefined.  Or
should we call it unsupported?

Thanks.
