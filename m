Hi Neil. It's a RAID10n2 of six disks, but I've also seen the behaviour on a
RAID1 of two disks around the time of 2.6.27.

The symptoms seem to be that I can't read or write to /dev/mdX but I can
read from the underlying /dev/sd* devices fine, at pretty much full speed. I
didn't try writing to them as there's lots of live customer data on the RAID
arrays!

The configuration is lvm2 (i.e. device-mapper linear targets) on top of md
on top of sd, and we've seen the symptoms with the virtual machines
accessing the logical volumes configured to open in O_SYNC mode, and with
them configured to open in O_DIRECT mode. During the deadlock, cat
/proc/mdstat does return promptly (i.e. not blocked), and shows a slow and
gradually falling sync rate---I think that there's no sync writing going on
either and the drives are genuinely idle. We have to reset the machine to
bring it back to life and a graceful reboot fails.

Anyway, I see this relatively infrequently, so what I'll try to do is to
create a reproducible test case and then follow up to you and the RAID list
with that. At the moment, I understand that my reports is a bit anecdotal,
and without a proper idea of what conditions are needed to make it happen
its pretty much impossible to diagnose or work on!

Cheers,

Chris.
