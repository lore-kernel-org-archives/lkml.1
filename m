I'll add the creation of a howto to my to-do list that describes how to
work with kmsg.

The message tag should uniquely identify the message so that the
translation projects have something to work with. If we keep changing
the message tag with each kernel release that will create a huge effort
to keep track of the messages.

I think the unique message ids are very important. If we change them all
the time this would severly limit the value of the kernel message
catalog.
