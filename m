Correct, see my earlier reply to Alan Stern for the details of 
why it got missed.

Both -tip and -rt are generic trees and there's a connection 
between them that the maintainers of both are one and the same 
set of people.

So i'm not sure on what grounds you purport to be able to 
prevent fixes from flowing from -tip into -rt and vice versa.

You have no monopoly on the propagation and testing of SCSI 
fixes. We picked up a v1 patch from the SCSI list and did not 
add nor remove anything from it.

Yes, v1 was buggy and I missed the v2 patch because it had the 
same subject line and no easily visible differentiator that it 
was a v2 patch.

In fact you should be happy that people are helping you out 
fixing your bugs. I never even thought of flaming anyone for 
having picked up a v1 scheduler fix and getting burned by it 
while a v2 existed. I find it unexplainable and irrational that 
you feel the need to do so for SCSI fixes.
