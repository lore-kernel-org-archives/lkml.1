Hmm, I might be wrong, but what I've seen that FCoE only at the 
beginning used linux-scsi for its intermediate patches, then such 
patches quickly went into FCoE internal development mailing list only. 
Then only resulting patches intended for wide review and mainline 
inclusion were sent to linux-scsi. This is how I thought it's usually 
considered should be done and how all the projects I've seen so far did.

I wouldn't object if Nicholas does the same and send in linux-scsi and 
linux-kernel a complete patchset, which we will review and discuss. But 
he sends *intermediate* patches and this looks for me like a violation 
of fundamental rules/intention of Linux kernel mailing lists, hence I 
complain.

So, should I understand your words that you agree if I also start 
sending intermediate patches for SCST to linux-scsi/linux-kernel?

Thanks for the suggestions, but, unfortunately, none of those filters 
can distinguish e-mails/patches sent by Nicholas Bellinger in some 
important SCSI target related discussion from his unsolicited 
intermediate patches, which I should ignore.
