[RESEND since I sent this late last friday and it's probably been buried by now.]

I had this as a PS, then I thought, we could all be wasting our time...

I don't like these "Section mismatch" warnings but that's because I'm paranoid
rather than because I know what they mean. I'll be happier when someone says
"That's OK, I know about them, they're not the problem"

I'm paranoid because Andrew Morton said a couple of weeks ago:

Anyhow...

No, but there are no apps accessing the filesystem. It's just available for NFS
serving. Seems safer before potentially hanging the machine?


Also I made these changes to the kernel:
cu:/boot# diff config-2.6.22-rc4-TejuTst-dbg3-dirty
config-2.6.22-rc4-TejuTst-dbg1-dirty
3,4c3,4

< CONFIG_DISABLE_CONSOLE_SUSPEND=y
< # CONFIG_PM_TRACE is not set

> # CONFIG_PM_DEBUG is not set

positive: I can now get sysrq-t :)
negative: if I build skge into the kernel the behaviour changes so I can't run
netconsole

Just to be sure I tested and this kernel suspends/restores with /huge unmounted.
It also hangs without an umount so the behaviour is the same.

So I added
# touch /huge/bork
# sync
# hibernate

And it still succeeded - sigh.

So I thought a bit and did:
rm /huge/b* /huge/foo

> Clean boot
> # touch /huge/bar
> # sync
> # echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
> # hibernate
hangs on suspend (sysrq-b doesn't work)

> Clean boot
> # touch /huge/baz
> # sync
> # echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
> # hibernate
hangs on suspend (sysrq-b doesn't work)

So I rebooted and hibernated to make sure I'm not having random behaviour - yep,
hang on resume (as per usual).

Now I wonder if any other mounts have an effect...
reboot and umount /dev/hdb2 xfs fs, - hang on hibernate


I'm confused. I'm going to order chinese takeaway and then find a serial cable...

David
PS 2.6.21.1 works fine.
PPS the takeaway was nice.
