That's what linux-next is for:  to make at least this compile checking
against all of our architectures more of a reality.  It's still missing
bits, and some of the ports (*cough* parisc *cough*) compile against
linux-next rather infrequently, but it's far better than nothing.

It's easily fixable, yes ... breaking the build *is* a pretty big thing
because of the fallout it causes (for ppc: about ~100 instant WTF
moments followed by grubbing around in git to find the cause).

It's also an indicator of future problems.  Realistically, all API
changes should go into linux-next both to prevent this sort of thing
from happening and to see if we have any other pending conflicts that
may cause problems.
