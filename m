I haven't actually ever said otherwise.  I have asserted that the bfa
driver, while large, isn't out of the ball park for a FC driver, that it
does provide all the correct user visible FC ABI pieces but that it does
have minor anomalies, primarily in bfa/include, that need cleaning up,
plus it needs to interface to libfc at some future point.  I have also
asserted that drivers/scsi is the best place to address the remaining
issues.

It's a judgement call whether a driver goes through staging or not.  I'm
happy to hear other opinions about this driver, but I'd like them to be
from reading the code, not generalities.  I've stated my specific
reasons why this driver isn't a good candidate for staging.

But no-one's actually said that.  The whole discussion was theoretical
rather than based on this driver.  My position on the generalities is
that ABI issues head a driver automatically for staging.  For non user
visible code based issues, it's a maintainer judgement call where the
cleanup is best done, which in turn depends on what the actual issues
are.  For this specific driver, I've given reasons several times why the
changes are best made in drivers/scsi.
