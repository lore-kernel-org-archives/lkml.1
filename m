The sg driver already has async via read/write, and it works fine.
Perhaps someone wants the ioctl versions too, but that's not my main
goal here.

I think that sg doesn't bother with compat iovec handling.  It just
uses SZ_SG_IOVEC (defined as sizeof(sg_iovec_t)) and doesn't check
if the userspace iovec happens to be smaller.  Sg does have a compat
ioctl function; it just doesn't support SG_IO.  So, on 64-bit
kernel, read/write from 32-bit userspace with iovec will get
undefined results due to the mis-interpretation of the iovec fields,
while ioctl from 32-bit will fail with ENOIOCTLCMD (EINVAL to
userspace).  Doesn't bother me at all, just an observation.  I'd
love to be able to take a similar approach with bsg: only support
iovec in 32-32 or 64-64 environments where kernel iovec == user
iovec.

I'm not going to patch up sg to add the SG_IO async ioctls.  My
greedy need requires bidirectional transfers and big CDBs, both of
which could be hacked into sg_io_hdr_t and sg, but it sure wouldn't
be pretty.  These were some of the reasons you proposed sgv4 as I
recall.
