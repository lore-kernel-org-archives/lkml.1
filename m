*cringe*

I really don't like the entire scheme, to be honest.  BTW, what happens
if you try to add the same device to the same array after having it kicked
out?  If that comes before your delayed kobject_del(), the things will
get nasty since sysfs will (rightfully) refuse to add another entry with
the same name and parent while the old one is still there and for all
sysfs knows is going to stay there...
