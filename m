There's a lot of JBD code which gets removed by this patch - cool :)

Looking through the patch, I don't see how you solve the page lock /
transaction ordering issues. I see that you avoid starting a handle in
->writepage during transaction commit, but what about another process which
starts a handle under page lock and needs to wait for transactions to be
written out before continuing?

My attempt at helpful review follows.

What happens to the data if we get here under the 1st case with a hole? Do
we eventually fill the hole (with correct data) via some mechanism I don't
see here?

AFAICT, this is called in ext3 before a handle is started for truncate. Is
it possible for the current running transaction to become the new committing
transaction shortly after the spinlock is dropped, but before the truncate
transaction starts? Could this lead to ordered data not being written out if
the inode is part of the current running transaction but not part of the
committing transaction?

Not sure what this is here for...
