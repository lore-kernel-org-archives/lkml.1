Transactions on that busier drive would take longer, we would sleep 
longer which would allow us to batch up more into one transaction. That 
should be a good result and it should reset when the drive gets less 
busy (and transactions shorter) to a shorter sleep time.

This is really, really a property of the device's latency at any given 
point in time. If there are no other processes running, we could do an 
optimization and not wait.

It causes the most expensive storage (arrays) to run 3-4 times slower 
than they should on a synchronous write workload (NFS server, mail 
server?) with more than 1 thread. For example, against a small EMC 
array, I saw single threaded write rates of 720 files/sec against ext3 
with 1 thread, 225 (if I remember correctly) with 2 ;-)

If you remove the code, you will not see the throughput rise when you go 
multithreaded on existing slow devices (S-ATA/ATA for example). Faster 
devices will not see that 2 threaded drop.

I have to admit that I don't see the down side here - we have shown a 
huge increase for arrays (embarrassingly huge  increase for RAM disks) 
and see no degradation for the S-ATA/ATA case.

The code is not broken (having been there and done the performance 
tuning on the original code), it just did not account for the widely 
varying average response times for different classes of storage ;-)
