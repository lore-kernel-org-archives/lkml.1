Are you sure? is it not:
+	good_bytes = scsi_bufflen(cmd) + cmd->request->extra_len

I hate this patch. I wish you could maybe take the extra_len into 
account inside blk_end_request. The padding should be transparent
to all concerned but the requesting LLD and the internals of the
block layer. If block layer added padding it should take that into
account on completion. My $0.2.
