I'm currently testing the patch below as a v3.

v3 uses cpu_active_mask to find an interrupt migration target.
This should fix both the oops we were seeing as well as avoid the
issues with RCU that Paul mentions above.

I also think that this fix is simpler for us to think through
rather than making Paul think through the implications of
changing RCU to use cpu_active_mask. :)

So far, it's survived ~45 minutes on my simple test bed (without
any patches, it usually crashes in < 15 minutes). I'm about to
start a longer run on our complex test system that runs under
heavy load.

Hopefully I'll have some results for tomorrow, in which case I'll
send a proper patch.

Thanks.
