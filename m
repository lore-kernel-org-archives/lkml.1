on some kernel versions you are correct about needing swap > ram, but on 
current versions you are not. the swap space gets allocated as needed, and 
re-used as needed (I don't know the mechanism of this, but I remember the 
last time this changed from vm=max(ram,swap) to vm=ram+swap)

it has been noted by many people that linux is very slow to pull things 
back into ram from swap, significantly slower then simple seed limiting 
would seem to account for.
