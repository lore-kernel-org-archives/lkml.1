In case you haven't realize it, the ia64 fallocate() patch comes with
Amit's takes 4 fallocate patch series (3/6) missing one line change,
thus fail to compile on ia64.

Here is the updated one. Patch tested on ia64. (compile and fsx)

fallocate() on ia64

ia64 fallocate syscall support.

Since both Amit and Ted are traveling, I will jump in...

Most likely it's not the same one. What in Ted's devel tree is "takes 2"
patches.

I have incorporated takes 4 patches in the backing ext4 patch git tree
here:
http://repo.or.cz/w/ext4-patch-queue.git

I have tested these patch series on ia64,ppc64,x86 and x86_64. I am not
sure if Ted got a chance to update his ext4 git tree from this patch
queue git tree yet.

Last time Ted and I discussed we all agree fallocate patches should go
into mainline. Actually most patches marked before the "unstable
patches" can get into mainline, especially the following patches
(contains a few bug fixes patches)

# New patch to fix whitespace before applying new patches
whitespace.patch
 
#New patch to remove unnecessary exported symbols
ext4_remove_exported_symbles.patch
 
# New patch to add mount option to turn off extents
ext4_noextent_mount_opt.patch
# Now Turn on extents feature by default
ext4_extents_on_by_default.patch
 
#New patch to propagate inode flags
ext4-propagate_flags.patch
 
#New patch to add extent sanity checks
ext4-extent-sanity-checks.patch
 
#New patch to free blocks when failed to insert an extent
ext4-free-blocks-on-insert-extent-failure.patch

We already missed rc-1 window, but if possible, I would like to see ext4
fallocate patches and above patches in mainline 2.6.22. The nanosecond
timestamp patch is probably good to go also.
