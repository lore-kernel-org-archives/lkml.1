Care to test/fix/improve the following. I just booted a normal disk,
didn't test a partitioned md device.

Thanks,

Subject: block: do_mounts - accept root=<non-existant partition>

Some devices, like md, may create partitions only at first access,
so allow root= to be set to a valid non-existant partition of an
existing disk. This applies only to non-initramfs root mounting.
