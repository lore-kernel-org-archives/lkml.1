we don't publish supported_events; we publish a single file called
media_change.  Right at the moment its meaning is I have a 1 if AN is
supported and 0 if it's not.

Before the fix, its meaning was  1 if AN is supported and 0 if it's not.

The file name now looks wrong ... it should probably be an_media_change
or something if we have to introduce a new file called poll_media_chage
to distinguish them ... but nothing's changed about the way it works.

Anyway, realistically, since no CD or DVD on the market today seems to
support the AHCI AN method, this argument is really moot ... we just
need polling to work.
