Hi James,

It is encouraging to know that we can discuss and add new feature into
existing fc transport. I guess this is opensource all about. I didn't
have linux opensource experience before, so I was not quite sure how
easy to request new features in fc transport such as mechanism to create
multiple subdirectories for different level of statistics info in
addition to the snia fc statitistics we already have, and other features
such as CT/SCSI passthru and asynchronous event notification etc.

Thanks

Jing

This isn't really a valid reason.  We use the fc transport class to
share infrastructure and provide a common interface for users.  If you
need more, we can discuss adding features to the fc transport class if
they would be useful to fibre drivers in general.  If they're not useful
to other drivers, then you can add pieces specific to your driver for
them, but the functionality that's already in the fc transport shouldn't
be duplicated by that.

That's how the fc transport class currently operates.  It's statistics
all appear in a "statistics" directory under the host.  If you use it
(and add the ones you need that are missing) everyone will be happy and
you won't need to worry about creating the directories.
