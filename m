Actually, it's normal for pdflush to spawn up to 8 threads when you're 
dirtying memory faster than it can be written to disk.  Load going to 4 
is not abnormal.  ssh logins taking minutes is very abnormal.

Does the machine become unresponsive during the single-threaded test, or 
only when doing the rsync?
