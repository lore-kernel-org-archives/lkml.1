You mean apart from ".... that high highly undesirable ...." ??
                               ^^^^^^^^^^^

And the phrase "Regular backups when using these devices ...." should
be "Regular backups when using any devices .....".
                               ^^^
If you have a device failure near a power fail on a raid5 you might
lose some blocks of data.  If you have a device failure near (or not
near) a power failure on raid0 or jbod etc you will certainly lose lots
of blocks of data.

I think it would be better to say:

   ".... and degraded DM/MD RAID 4/5/6(*) arrays..."
             ^^^^^^^^
with
(*) If device failure causes the array to become degraded during or
immediately after the power failure, the same problem can result.

And "necessary" only have the one 'c' :-)
