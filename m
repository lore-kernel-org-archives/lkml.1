But what rationale? It just doesn't make much sense to me.

You could just have added it to feature groups over time.

Are you sure?

But only for the stack setup which is just a minor detail. 

The basic clone() flags interface used to be pretty sane and usable 
before it could overloaded with so many tiny features.

I especially worry on how user land should keep track of changing kernel
here. If you add new feature flag for lots of kernel features it is
reasonable to expect that in the future there will be often new features.

Does this mean user land needs to be updated all the time? Will this
end up like another udev? 

> We will need a user library, like we have a libphtread or a libaio, to

That doesn't make sense. The basic kernel syscalls should be usable,
not require some magic library that would likely need intimate 
knowledge of specific kernel versions to do any good.

> but we still need a way to extend the clone flags because none are left.

Can we just take out some again that were added in the .25 cycle and
readd them once there is a properly thought out interface?  That would
leave at least one.
