I like the idea of a C/R filesystem. Does it implies a specific user 
space program to orchestrate the checkpoint/restart of the different 
subsystems ? I mean the checkpoint is easy but what about the restart ? 
We must ensure, for example to restore a process before restoring the fd 
associated to it, or restore a deleted file before restoring the fd 
opened to it, no ?
