We don't know what happens in the future. And that is the problem that we 
don't know --- but we have two pieces of code (blk-merge and iommu) that 
try to calculate the same number (number of hw segments) and if they get 
different result, it will crash. If the calculations were done at one 
place, there would be no problem with that.
