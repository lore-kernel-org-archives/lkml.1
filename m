OK, then the check does what you want. It'll tell you that you have a
pending request, and at least one other queue has one too. And that
could dispatch right after you finish yours, depending on idling etc.
Note that this _only_ applies to queues that have requests still sitting
in CFQ, as soon as they are on the dispatch list in the block layer they
will only be counted as busy if they still have sorted IO waiting.

But that should be OK already, since I switched CFQ to dispatch single
requests a few revisions ago. So we should not run into that anymore.
