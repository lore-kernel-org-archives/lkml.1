Ok, but you don't describe messages with "0" in them :)

Why can't the message reporting change?  What's the reluctance for
change here for something that did happen to move to a different file?
It shouldn't matter _at all_ as you are only looking at the
tags/messages for a specific kernel version to ensure they match up.
Any future kernel version might have different ones.

It's not like once you write a message/tag it will stay that way fixed
for all time, that's just not going to fly with the way the Linux kernel
is developed.

The message tag should not dictate anything except how to look it up
somehow.  So it doesn't matter if the name changes, as long as the
ability to get the real information is still there.

So the kernel could change the tags every other release and there would
be no problem.
