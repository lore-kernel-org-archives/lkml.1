Events Cleared is *larger* than Events!!! Is that repeatable?  I can
only see it happening if a very small race were lost.  You don't have
any other patches in there do you?

No, you weren't suppose to combine it with the previous patch.

This patch should close the race, though I still find it hard to
believe that you lost the race.
