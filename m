No, it has to do with the way invalidation occurs.  When you mmap a
region from a device or file, the kernel places page translations for
that region into your vm_area.  The regions themselves aren't backed
until faulted.  For write (i.e. incoming command to target) you specify
the write flag and send the area off to receive the data.  The gather,
expecting the pages to be overwritten, backs them with pages marked
dirty but doesn't fault in the contents (unless it already exists in the
page cache).  The kernel writes the data to the pages and the dirty
pages go back to the user.  msync() flushes them to the device.

The disadvantage of all this is that the handle for the I/O if you will
is a virtual address in a user process that doesn't actually care to see
the data. non-x86 architectures will do flushes/invalidates on this
address space as the I/O occurs.

Well, there's no real evidence that zero copy or lack of it is a problem
yet.
