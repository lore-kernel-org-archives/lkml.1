Actually rcu_dereference didn't have ACCESS_ONCE when I did this.
That only appearaed later with the preemptible RCU work.

The original purpose of rcu_dereference was exactly to replace the
explicit barriers that people were using for RCU, nothing more,
nothing less.

Oh and I totally agree that the compiler is going to generate insane
code whenever ACCESS_ONCE is used.  In this case we may have avoided
it by rearranging the code, but in general the introduction of ACCESS_ONCE
in rcu_dereference is likely to have a negative impact on the code
generated.

Remember that "volatile" discussion? I think this is where it all came
from.
