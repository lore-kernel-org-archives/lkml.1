as you already discovered, that's because the initramfs hook script for
cryptroot adds some crypto modules manually in debian. currently these
are dm-mod, dm-crypt, cbc, aes, sha256 and all the modules they depend
on.

ok, i see the point that it's not enough to simply add some additional
dependencies in order to fix the problem. seems like an easy solution
doesn't exist.

i don't like the idea to add _all_ crypto modules into the initramfs per
default. the size of crypto and arch/<arch>/crypto will keep on growing
for kernels which do have ship all available modules for ciphers and
implementations. i think that the initramfs should be a _minimal_
system, and detecting the required crypto modules should be possible.

alternative crypto cipher and blockcipher modules are already detected
if required, as information about these are available from the cryptroot
configuration (either luks header or cmdline options given to cryptsetup).

i added cryptomgr, chainiv and krng to the list of required modules in
/usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/cryptroot for now.

still i see the point that this solution has it's drawbacks. modules for
crypto hardware and cipher implementations not following the convention to
call modules <cipher>_generic and <cipher>-alias aren't detected by the
current system.

i guess the best solution would be to improve the module dependency
system. cipher meta-modules like 'aes' should depend on all available
implementations. same for ivciphers, hashs, rng implementations etc.

what do you think about it?

greetings,
 jonas
