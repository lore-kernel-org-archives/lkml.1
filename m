In the initial version of the section mismatch check code
I ignored references to .exit.text from .init.text code.
Today I do not see why this should be allowed.
So unless an allmodconfig build for i386 + maybe a few more archs
does not show any significant regressions I will enable this check.

My initial i386 allmodconfig build pointed out a number of places
where this happened (I lost the warnings and are doing a rebuild now)A
.
One such place is microcode.c where we has

static int __init microcode_init (void)
{
	...

	if (IS_ERR(microcode_pdev)) {
		microcode_dev_exit();
		return PTR_ERR(microcode_pdev);
	}

And:
static void __exit microcode_dev_exit (void)
{
	misc_deregister(&microcode_dev);
}

I assume this is a real bug that we have not triggered
during testing becasue this is in an error-path.

The linker will not error out because .exit.text are discarded
at run-time at least for i386.
