Ok. I'm just trying to find a relatively simple test case for the
problem - seeing as you seem to be able to reliably reproduce this
we should be able to work out the trigger...

Yes, because LVM snapshot freezes the filesystem for you - if you've
already frozen the filesystem the snapshot will block until you unfreeze
it and then it will freeze it itself to take the snapshot.

No idea.....
