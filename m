The main improvement I'm seeing is in number of over the wire COMMIT
operations. With a standard 2.6.32/33 kernel without these changes, if I
do something like

   iozone -t 8 -s 512m -r 128k -i0 -i1

on my old 2GB test machines then I end up seeing 1 COMMIT going on the
wire for every 4 WRITE requests. IOW: I force the server to fsync for
every 4x256K I send it.

With the new code, I'm seeing 1 COMMIT being sent for every 50 WRITE
requests.

Writeback throughput is slightly, but not hugely improved on my test
rig. Furthermore, the maximum number of unstable writes recorded
in /proc/meminfo doesn't appear to change much. All this points to the
fact that most of those extra COMMIT calls were going out for just 1 or
2 writes, probably as a result of looping in balance_dirty_pages() while
the server was busy dealing with the first COMMIT.

It is definitely worth getting rid of that extra spam to the server,
though. Furthermore, I believe that others reported larger performance
improvements when the number of commits went down.

Cheers
