But I think where this is leading is that you've been using the geometry
call, but all you really want to know is the actual partition start in
sector units, so a new BLKGETPARTSTART (or something) ioctl that was
designed to return a u64 would work for you?  That sounds reasonable to
me; so not a HDIO_GETGEO64 which gets us into trouble with geometries,
but a simple ioctl that gives you exactly what you're looking for.
