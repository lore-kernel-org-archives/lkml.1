This is precisely what I did for libata, here is is interleaved with
some other stuff:

http://git.kernel.dk/?p=linux-2.6-block.git;a=commitdiff;h=f557570ec6042370333b6b9c33bbbae175120a89

It needs a little more polish and so on, but the concept is identical to
what you describe for this case. And I agree, it's much better to use
the same index instead of generating/maintaining seperate bitmaps for
this type of thing.
