I'm not sure that the users of the timeout feature can control exact
timeouts because the block layer doesn't let the users directly play
with the timer. elv_dequeue_request() is not the exact time that the
users want to start the timer. Instead, the block layer hides the
details behind the elevator (note that as I said before, I think that
it's the right thing). So the round_jiffies in the block layer doesn't
make sense to me. I prefer remove them instead of adding a bunch of
round_jiffies_up_* (I bet that some of them will never be used).
