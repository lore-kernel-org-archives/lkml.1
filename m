Hi Linus,

Please pull from:

        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4.git for_linus

This is the major set of updates meant for 2.6.24 from the ext4 team;
these patches have been baking in -mm for a while.  The two major
features included here is the multi-block allocator that has been in use
by Clusterfs for their luster filesystem, as well as the journal
checksumming features.  There were also a huge number of clean ups and
various bug fixes.

Regards,

						- Ted
