Yes.  Each of the unsuccessful reads, whether retried or not, lasted
less than one millisecond.  So that's probably not the reason.

That would be my guess too.  I don't know how to verify it, though.

If you're interested in pursuing this farther, I can show you how to 
generate equivalent errors on demand using an emulated USB drive.  
At this point it's not clear how much more one could learn by doing 
this, however.
