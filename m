Really?  What a mess :(

Can't we just protect the list?  What is wanting to write to the list
while shutdown is happening?

Can't you just not do this?

I agree, this patch isn't ok, it should be handled in the scsi core as
it looks like a scsi problem, not a driver core problem, right?

That shouldn't really solve the problem, right?

So the scsi core is trying to remove a device at the same time shutdown
is happening, right?  So we need to protect the list somehow, maybe just
switch it over to use a klist which should handle this for us instead?
Can you try that?

thanks,
