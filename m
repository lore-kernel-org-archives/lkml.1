Heh, well I tried several approaches - adding tag_ops to kset, to ktype,
etc.  Finally ended up just calling sysfs_enable_tagging on
/sys/kernel/uids when that is created.  It's now working perfectly.

I had ported your patches to 2.6.25, but Benjamin in the meantime ported
them to 2.6.25-mm1.  Since that's closer to the -net tree it's a more
useful port, so I'll let him post his patchset.  Then I'll send the
userns patch on top of that.  While I'm not actually able to send
network traffic over a veth dev (I probably am still not setting it up
right), I am able to pass veth devices into network namespaces, and the
user namespaces are properly handled.

I believe Benjamin did notice a problem with some symlinks not existing,
and I think we want one more patch on top of yours removing the
hold_net() from sysfs_mount, which I don't think was what you really
wanted to do.  By simply removing that, if all tasks in a netns go away,
the netns actually goes away and a lookup under a bind-mounted copy of
its /sys/class/net is empty.

Anyway the patches should be hitting the list next week.

I'm not sure I'm familiar enough with the kobject/class/sysfs/device
relationships yet to comment on that.  It doesn't look like it should
really be a problem, though simply adding tags to every directory
under /sys/class (/sys/class/tty, /sys/class/usb_device, etc) doesn't
seem like necessarily the nicest way to go...

thanks,
