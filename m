  Thanks Ted for looking into this. Yes, the problem is caused by my
modifications to quota code... The patch below fixes it for me and I've
also added a comment so that someone does not remove the check again in
future ;).

Subject: [PATCH] quota: Don't call sync_fs() from vfs_quota_off() when there's no quota turn off

Sometimes, vfs_quota_off() is called on a partially set up super block (for example
when fill_super() fails for some reason). In such cases we cannot call ->sync_fs()
because it can Oops because of not properly filled in super block. So in case we
find there's not quota to turn off, we just skip everything and return which fixes
the above problem.
