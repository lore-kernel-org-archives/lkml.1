No, there are more printks in the system then just dev_printk. The kmsg interface
is supposed to cover all of them.

It is fixed in the macro for standard kmsg printks, there the message
tag is the first field. It is fixed in the macro for the dev_printk
variant of the kmsg message, there it is the third field. This mismatch
I refer to as not have a fixed position, for some message (the standard
ones) it is at the start of the final message, for others (the
dev_printk ones) it is in the middle of the message. Not good.

Then lets look at how this will look like. First a standard printk
message and its conversion to kmsg:
	printk(KERN_WARNING
               "cpcmd: could not allocate response buffer\n");
vs.
	kmsg_warn(1, "The cpcmd kernel function failed "
                     "to allocate a response buffer\n");

The message comes out as
	cpcmd: cound not allocate response buffer
vs.
	cpcmd.1: The cpcmd kernel function failed to allocate a response buffer

As an example for a dev_printk I use a message from the zfcp driver:
	dev_warn(&req->adapter->ccw_device->dev,
                 "The local link is down: no light detected.\n");
vs.
        kmsg_dev_warn(27, &req->adapter->ccw_device->dev,
                 "The local link is down: no light detected.\n");

The dev_printk versus the original kmsg macro comes out as
	zfcp: 0.0.1234: The local link is down: no light detected.
vs.
	zfcp.27: 0.0.1234: The local link is down: no light detected.

If I would just use dev_printk in kmsg_dev_warn as proposed by Greg:
	zfcp: 0.0.1234: zfcp.27: The  local link is down: no light detected.

If the message component is skipped from the message tag:
	zfcp: 0.0.1234: 27: The  local link is down: no light detected.

Is it just me who thinks that the later two message variants are crap?
