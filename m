Would that be very different from issuing barrier and not waiting for
its completion?  For ATA and SCSI, we'll have to flush write back cache
anyway, so I don't see how we can get performance advantage by
implementing separate WRITE_ORDERED.  I think zero-length barrier
(haven't looked at the code yet, still recovering from jet lag :-) can
serve as genuine barrier without the extra write tho.

Thanks.
