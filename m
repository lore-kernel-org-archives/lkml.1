  Hi Vivek,

  I think you're right.
  A thought comes to my mind, whether can we extend optimization for not expiring
  an ioq not only for root group, but for single ioq case? IOW, if there is only
  one ioq in hierarchy, we don't exipre it until another ioq gets backlogged, and
  we just charge only one time slice for that ioq when it schedule out. This might
  help if IO only happens in child group.
