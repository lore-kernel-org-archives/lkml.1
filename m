For some strange reason (probably something I'm doing wrong or maybe
something environmental), I've not been able to reproduce this panic on
a stock kernel. I did, however, apply the following fault injection
patch and was able to reproduce it on the second mount attempt. The 3
patch set that I posted last week definitely prevents the oops. If
you're able to confirm that it also fixes your panic it would be a
helpful data point.

The fault injection patch I'm using is attached. It just simulates
nfs4_init_client() consistently returning an error.
