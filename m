	Mind that this is an ide hard drive in a usb enclosure, not sata.
The error reported is bizzare. I don't know if I'll be able to get the
enclosure to cause the error on demand, but before I try supergluing it,
I'll try to do whatever I need to do with usbmon so we can get the error
that's actually happening so you can do whatever you need to do to track it
down :)
