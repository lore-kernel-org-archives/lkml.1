Hi,

I have similar problem with my two Sun T2000 machines.
During last week I got two times a degraded array. Everytime another
disk is kicked of the array. On the other T2000 machine the same happend
multiple times in the past too. The interesting part is, it is always the
same sector involved on every disk as in the original report. After a manual resync of the disks it
seems to work for some time until it is failing again. smart doesn't show
any errors on the disks.
