because the use model of the device still requires a valid target.  Even
though it gets gated in several places in SDEV_DEL, we still have use of
the target parent.  This is fixable, but only by a long audit of all the
sdev uses plus the enforcement of no use of target in DEL state rule,
which adds complexity.

And SHOST_CANCEL and SHOST_CANCEL_RECOVERY.

If the child list were empty, sure.  However, it's likely not going to
be at this point.

No, that's the problem.  It can be removed from visibility if it has no
visible sdevs, but it can't be deleted until the last sdev is released.
