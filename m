Lets move out the corrupted directory ;)

Without any problem, we have 24/7/365 physical access and we don't need=20
to provide high-availability services.

Anyway, the data hosted aren't that important, there is little or even=20
no need for strict confidentiality, so we will be happy to provide ssh=20
access to whom would like to look deeper into this issue.

There are some error messages on NFS clients, however they are quite old.

Apr 19 15:38:21 gin kernel: NFS: Buggy server - nlink =3D=3D 0!
May  3 20:00:52 gin kernel: NFS: Buggy server - nlink =3D=3D 0!

May 26 12:39:43 cognac kernel: NFS: Buggy server - nlink =3D=3D 0!

This is obviously related to the corruption.
