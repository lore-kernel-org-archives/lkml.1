Nicholas, you think too iSCSI centric. From access control POV only 2 
thing matter:

1. Target name - to assign to it a default access control group (ACL, if 
you like that name), i.e. an ACL for initiators not listed in other ACLs

2. Initiator name - to assign it to the corresponding ACL.

It doesn't matter if those names are IQNs for iSCSI or WWNs for FC, or 
bus:id:lun for parallel SCSI.

For example, consider target "TTT", which has 2 ACLs: "Default" with 
Device1 as LUN 0 and "Group1" with "Device2" as LUN 0. "Group1" 
specified for initiator "III1". Then when initiator "III1" connected to 
target "TTT", it would be assigned to "Group1" and see "Device2". If 
then initiator "III2" connected, it would be assigned to "Default" ACL 
and see "Device1". "Default" group can be empty, if necessary. There's 
nothing transport specific in this approach at all.

I strongly suggest you to look at SCST access control approach and make 
sure you understand it before reply. It would save us a lot of time and 
effort. Note, this approach isn't something theoretical. It's proved by 
4 years of successful usage.

Also, it would be good, if you shift your terminology to be less iSCSI 
specific and use the corresponding terms from SAM, where possible. We 
are discussing a config interface for a generic target engine, aren't 
we? Otherwise sometimes it's quite hard for me to understand you and I 
have strong suspicions that other people are getting or already got lost 
in it.

Creating and managing the necessary configfs entries.

Hmm, I looked at the code and in lio_target_initiator_nacl_info() saw 
something like:

		rb += sprintf(page+rb, "LIO Session ID: %u   "
			"ISID: 0x%02x %02x %02x %02x %02x %02x  "
			"TSIH: %hu  ", sess->sid,
			sess->isid[0], sess->isid[1], sess->isid[2],
			sess->isid[3], sess->isid[4], sess->isid[5],
			sess->tsih);
		rb += sprintf(page+rb, "SessionType: %s\n",
				(SESS_OPS(sess)->SessionType) ?
				"Discovery" : "Normal");
		rb += sprintf(page+rb, "Cmds in Session Pool: %d  ",
				atomic_read(&sess->pool_count));
		rb += sprintf(page+rb, "Session State: ");

It doesn't look for me like it addresses the PAGE_SIZE limitation issue.
