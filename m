Attachments under roughly 100kb (IIRC) are fine for LKML. This is
allowed specifically to let people attach log files and configs.

I've re-added the lkml CC to continue the discussion there.  I also
added the DM mailing list, so that they know directly that barriers
are causing _significant_ system slowdowns. This is important,
because there have been several reports of this problem since the
start of the year to XFS forums as people are upgrading kernels.

And the stack traces confirm that. Every single blocked process
output set has this trace in it:

That is, it appears that DM is blocking waiting for a barrier to
complete. Everything else is backed up waiting for IO completion to
occur...

They are blocking in:

 [<ffffffff813dc0e1>] md_super_wait+0xc1/0xe0
 [<ffffffff810789c0>] ? autoremove_wake_function+0x0/0x40
 [<ffffffff813dc4e0>] md_update_sb+0x230/0x3b0
 [<ffffffff813de2f2>] md_check_recovery+0x272/0x590
 [<ffffffffa0063621>] raid5d+0x21/0x320 [raid456]
 [<ffffffff813dbd94>] md_thread+0x44/0x120

I'm assuming this is just taking a long time because of all the
other IO that is going on slowing this down. The other 3 (xfssyncd,
kdmflush) are all waiting for barrier IO to complete...

So it sounds like the immediate WAR for your extremely slow IO
problem is to mount the XFS filesystems with "-o nobarrier", but
keep in mind this can result in corruption if a crash occurrs.

Cheers,

Dave.
