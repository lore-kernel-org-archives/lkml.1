We have been going around in circles for past many months on this
issue of IO controller. I thought that we are getting closer to a
point where we agree on one approach and go with it, but apparently we
are not. I think it would be useful at this point to learn from the
example of how similar functionality was introduced for other
resources like cpu scheduling and memory controllers.

We are starting from a point where there is no cgroup based resource
allocation for disks and there is a lot to be done. CFS has been doing
hierarchical proportional allocation for CPU scheduling for a while
now. Only recently someone has sent out patches for enforcing upper
limits. And it makes a lot of sense (more discussion on this later).
Also Fernando tells me that memory controller did not support
hierarchies in the first attempt. What I don't understand is, if we
are starting from scratch, why do we want to solve all the problems of
IO scheduling in one attempt?

Max bandwidth Controller or Proportional bandwidth controller
===============================================

Enforcing limits is applicable in the scenario where you are managing
a bunch of services in a data center and you want to either charge
them for what they use or you want a very predictable performance over
time. If we just do proportional allocation, then the actual
performance received by a user depends on other co-scheduled tasks. If
other tasks are not using the resource, you end up using their share.
But if all the other co-users become active, the 'extra' resource that
you had would be taken away. Thus without enforcing some upper limit,
predictability gets hurt.  But this becomes an issue only if we are
sharing resources. The most important precondition to sharing
resources is 'the requirement to provide isolation'. And isolation
includes controlling both bandwidth AND latency, in the presence of
other sharers. As Vivek has rightly pointed out, a ticket allocation
based algorithm is good for enforcing upper limits, but it is NOT good
for providing isolation i.e. latency control and even bandwidth in
some cases (as Vivek has shown with results in the last few emails).
Moreover, a solution that is implemented in higher layers (be it VFS
or DM) has little control over what happens in IO scheduler, again
hurting the isolation goal.

In the absence of isolation, we cannot even start sharing a resource.
The predictability or billing are secondary concerns that arise only
if we are sharing resources. If there is somebody who does not care
about isolation, but want to do their billing correctly, I would like
to know about it. Needless to say that max bandwidth limits can also
be enforced at IO scheduling layer.

Common layer vs CFS
==================

Takuya has raised an interesting point here. If somebody wishes to use
noop, using a common layer IO controller on top of noop isn't
necessarily going to give them the same thing. In fact, with IO
controller, noop might behave much like CFQ.

Moreover at one point, if we decide that we absolutely need IO
controller to work for other schedulers too, we have this Vivek's
patch set as a proof-of-concept. For now, as Jens very rightly pointed
out in our discussion, we can have a "simple scheduler: Noop" and an
"intelligent scheduler: CFQ with cgroup based scheduling".

Class based scheduling
===================

CFQ has this notion of classes that needs to be supported in any
solution that we come up with, otherwise we break the semantics of the
existing scheduler. We have workloads which have strong latency
requirements. We have two options: either don't do resource sharing
for them OR share the resource but put them in a higher class (RT) so
that their latencies are not (or minimally) effected by other
workloads running with them.

A solution in higher layer can try to support those semantics, but
what if somebody wants to use a Noop scheduler and does not care about
those semantics? We will end up with multiple schedulers in the upper
layers, and who knows where all this will stop.

Controlling writeback
================

It seems like writeback path has problems, but we should not try to
solve those problems with the same patch set that is trying to do
basic cgroup based IO scheduling. Jens patches for per-bdi pdflush are
already in. They should solve the problem of pdflush not sending down
enough IOs; at least Jens results seem to show that. IMHO, the next
step is to use memory controller in conjunction with IO controller,
and a per group per bdi pdflush threads (only if a group is doing IO
on that bdi), something similar to io_group that we have in Vivek's
patches. That should solve multiple problems. First, it would allow us
to obviate the need of any tracking for dirty pages. Second, we can
build a feedback from IO scheduling layer to the upper layers. If the
number of pending writes in IO controller for a given group exceed a
limit, we block the submitting thread (pdflush), similar to current
congestion implementation. Then the group would start hitting dirty
limits at one point (we would need per group dirty limits, as has
already been pointed out by others), thus blocking the tasks that are
dirtying the pages. Thus using a block layer IO controller, we can
achieve the affect similar achieved by Righi's proposal.

Vivek has summarized most of the other arguments very well. In short,
what I am trying to say is lets start with something very simple that
satisfies some of the most important requirements and we can build
upon that.
