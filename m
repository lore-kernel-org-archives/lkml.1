OK, this is a bad patch, so just revert it.  It was posted to linux-scsi
initially in this form before the author posted a new one with the
missing release buffers added.  It looks like the first incarnation got
pulled into the -rt tree for some reasons.

So the real question is why does the -rt tree even have patches not in
the vanilla SCSI tree?  This type of cockup clearly demonstrates why
it's a bad idea.
