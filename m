The choice is between "new magic OSD fs" and "new fs that used to be 
ext4, before we hacked it up".

"existing one you trust" is not an option...

Yeah, at this point the discussion devolves into talk of carts, horses,

His number, not mine...

At this point OSD is a fun and interesting research project.

Overall, I think Linux should have OSD support so that we are ready for 
whatever the future brings.  Even if OSD goes nowhere, it will still 
have more users than many of the existing Linux drivers and architectures :)
