Um, yes, I think I do.

Pretty much all the ones that present a USB disk interface to the outside 
world and then thus have to do hardware levelling.  Here's Valerie Aurora on 
the topic:

That's what something like jffs2 will do, sure.  (And note that mounting those 
suckers is slow while it reads the whole disk to figure out what order to put 
the chunks in.)

However, your average consumer level device A) isn't very smart, B) is judged 
almost entirely by price/capacity ratio and thus usually won't even hide 
capacity for bad block remapping.  You expect them to have significant hidden 
capacity to do safer updates with when customers aren't demanding it yet?

I've never seen one that presented a USB disk interface that _didn't_ do this.  
(Not that this observation means much.)  Neither the windows nor the Macintosh 
world is calling for this yet.  Even the Linux guys barely know about it.  And 
these are the same kinds of manufacturers that NOPed out the flush commands to 
make their benchmarks look better...

Yup.  It's got enough of one to get past the warantee, but beyond that they're 
intended for archiving and sneakernet, not for running compiles on.

The VFS layer cares about how to talk to the backing store?  I thought that 
was the filesystem driver's job...

I wonder how jffs2 gets around it, then?  (Or for that matter, squashfs...)
