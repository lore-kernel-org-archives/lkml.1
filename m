Hi

sorry for late responce. my e-mail reading speed is very slow ;-)

First, Could you please read past thread?
I think many topic of this mail are already discussed.

No.
Now, we talk about off-node allocation vs unnecessary file cache dropping.
IOW, off-node allocation vs disk access.

Then, the worth doesn't only depend on off-node distance, but also depend on
workload IO tendency and IO speed.

Fujitsu has 64 core ia64 HPC box, zone-reclaim sometimes made performance
degression although its box. 

So, I don't think this problem is small vs large machine issue.
nor i7 issue.
high-speed P2P CPU integrated memory controller expose old issue.

hmmm..
I don't hope ignore AMD, I think it's common characterastic of P2P and
integrated memory controller machine.

Also, I don't hope detect CPU family or similar, because we need update
such code evey when Intel makes new cpu.

Can we detect P2P interconnect machine? I'm not sure.

hmhm. 
I think the key-point of option 1 and 2 are proper hardware detecting way.

option 3 and 4 are more prefere idea to me. I like workload adapted heuristic.
but you already pointed out its hard, because page-allocator don't know
allocation purpose ;)

arch/ia64/include/asm/topology.h has

	/*
	 * Distance above which we begin to use zone reclaim
	 */
	#define RECLAIM_DISTANCE 15


I don't think distance==15 is machine independent proper definition.
but there is long lived definition ;)
