It's certainly something I've been lobbying for for a while.  There's
various new warnings that crop up, and I wasn't able to log into the
system Tony offered me to fix it on.  Maybe someone who cares about ia64
these days could take care of fixing up the remaining warnings?

I see http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-ia64/2008/10/19/3945454
is out there.  There might be a more recent version ... somewhere ...
Perhaps Tony has a copy of it?
