Thanks for looking into this, Neil. I wasn't sure how hard a reservation that
was (still working on wrapping my brain around the RPC code). I'll have a look
at the patch you posted. Hopefully that is the problem...

As far as your suggestion to use RPC_MAX_AUTH_SIZE, that sounds like a good
idea to me. I'm all for avoiding "magic" numbers. How does this look? I also
cleaned up the comments as well.
