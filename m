Heh... and there have been plenty of IO errors and timeouts coming
from hddtemp.  :-)

I don't know.  The problem is with test coverage.  As those aren't
used too often, they don't get tested too much so the coverage of the
blacklist wouldn't be too good and so on and there's very good reason
why those aren't used too often.  They're not all that useful for most
people.

There are plenty drives and configurations like that and different
drives need different APM value to function properly.  storage-fixup
deals exactly with the problem.

 http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/tj/storage-fixup.git;a=summary

But please note that it's only done once during boot and resume on
machines which are known to specifically need it and with values
reported to work.

Yeap, well, that's what vendors do.  They put together specific subset
of components and try to figure out configurations which work.  If you
replace components on your own, they won't guarantee it will work.
Sucky but that's the way it is.

The feature probabaly doesn't have much to do with the frequent head
unload problem.  Unplugging or pluggin in the AC cord also triggered
APM commands to be issued so it's more likely they were trying to
optimize performance / power balance.  The only problem is that APM
setting values aren't clearly defined and just are not too well
tested.

Yes, a possibility but we're unlikely to build meaningful coverage and
likely to prevent valid usages too.  ie. A firmware might lock up when
APM settings are adjusted continuously while setting it once after
booting is fine.  I really want to avoid implementing such logics for
different drives in kernel.

Yeap, sure, but it just doesn't work very well, not yet at least.
SMART is usually better tested than APM but given the number of
reports I've seen from hddtemp users, certain aspects of it are broken
on many drives.  There isn't a clear answer.  For usual parts of
SMART, it's probably pretty safe but then again don't go too far with
it.  Do it every several hours or every day not every ten secs.  APM
is way more dangerous, if your machine needs it use it minimally.  If
certain combination of values are known to work for the particular
configuration, go ahead and use it.  In other cases, just stay away
from it.

What people use often get tested and verified by vendors and promptly
fixed.  What people don't use often won't be and will be unreliable.
If you want to do things people usually don't do, it's your
responsibility to ensure it actually works.

Thanks.
