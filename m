Vz is the page discarded state. The difference to Uz is slim, both
states will cause a program check on access. Vz generates a discard
fault, Uz generates an addressing exception which is nice for debugging.
But I don't see a reason why an implementation that uses Uz instead of
Vz shouldn't work.

You mean in the section that speaks about the guests states S/U/V/P ?
Always keep in mind that you can access a V/P page only until it gets
discarded. Then the useful content of the page frame is lost and any
read of write to the not Vz page will be answered with a discard fault.

A Vr page is read-only. If a page gets mapped for writing it needs to
get into the Pr state. This is the hint for the host to look at the
dirty bit before it discards a page.
So yes, there is no use for a writable Vr page.
