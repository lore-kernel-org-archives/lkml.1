Yes, this piece of code of allocating tag, in itself, is safe.
But the following

	if (unlikely(!__test_and_clear_bit(tag, bqt->tag_map))) {
		printk(KERN_ERR "%s: attempt to clear non-busy tag
(%d)\n",
		       __FUNCTION__, tag);
		return;
	}

code of freeing tag (in blk_queue_end_tag())seems to be using
unsafe __test_and_clear_bit instead of test_and_clear_bit.
I once changed it to test_and_clear_bit and thought it was fixed.
But the panic happened thereafter nonetheless(using gcc 3.4.6.
gcc 4.1.0 is better but still with kernel errors). bqt also needs
to be protected in this case. Replacing queue lock per device with
a host lock is a simple but logical fix for it. To introduce a
more refined lock is possible, but seems too tedious and elaborate
for this issue, since a queue lock is already out there, and a
hostwide lock is needed anyway.

Thanks,

Ed Lin
