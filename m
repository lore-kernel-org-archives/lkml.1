I should probably clarify -- in the hypothetical situation above,
the setattr function would have to call generic_attrkill (as most
filesystems should do with this change).

That's not a bad idea at all. I suppose that would be easier than
modifying every fs like this, and it does seem like it might be
cleaner. I need to mull it over, but that might be the best
solution.
