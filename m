A little optimisation note.

You don't need the barrier after in some cases, or it can be deferred
until a better time.  E.g. when the disk write cache is probably empty
(some time after write-idle), barrier flushes may take the same time
as NOPs.

This sequence:

    #1 write metadata to journal
    #1 write commit block (checksummed)
  BARRIER
    #1 write metadata in place
  ... time passes ...
    #2 write metadata to journal
    #2 write commit block (checksummed)
  BARRIER
    #2 write metadata in place
  ... time passes ...
    #3 write metadata to journal
    #3 write commit block (checksummed)
  BARRIER
    #3 write metadata in place

Can be rewritten as:

    #1 write metadata to journal
    #1 write commit block (checksummed)
  ... time passes ...
    #2 write metadata to journal
    #2 write commit block (checksummed)
  ... time passes ...
    #3 write metadata to journal
    #3 write commit block (checksummed)
  ... time passes ...
  BARRIER (probably instant).
    #1 write metadata in place
    #2 write metadata in place
    #3 write metadata in place

Provided some conditions hold.  All the metadata and all the journal
writes being non-overlapping I/O ranges would be sufficient.

What's more, barriers can be deferred past data=ordered in-place data
writes, although that's not always an optimisation.
