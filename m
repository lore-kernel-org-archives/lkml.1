I hear you. I'm paying close attention and noting down all of above
hazardous signals. However, please allow me my own on-look on the matter.
Perhaps one day soon, (Probably not in LSF, no travel budget approval yet),
we will meet and we can talk about it more closely, and maybe I could
convince you of other aspects as well.

But pragmatically speaking. All the above has nothing that I can do about it.
My job is to show an OO reference implementation of pNFS-objects, a public
and signed protocol. I admit that pNFS-objects is a Panasas's pet, which is
my boss and the inventor of pNFS. I hope to remove it from your above
SuperWhizBang category, please. Actually my job is so it will not be. I want
an open standard implementation from day one, so there will be no questions. I
understand that you argue about the do or die of the OSD protocol under pNFS.
For me it is just that much more challenge of swimming up stream, as a Salmon.
Everyone is doing "Files" I get to do "Objects". I hope when finally the code
will arrive, soon, and it gets to be used, it's merits, performance, security,
and ease-of-use will win users over, big time.
(Lets compare notes, what is the minimal NFS DS implementation you can imagine?
 What would you say an OSD's target is? not counting all the extras an OSD gives
 you, like no proprietary back-channel protocol between MDS-to-DS inside the cluster.)

But I do hear you, really, you have very valid points that must be taken into consideration.

Thanks
Boaz
