That may be so, but there is nothing to protect the 64-bit ioctl() call,
should someone choose to make one.

That's probably right.

Maybe, but have you looked at i2o_cfg_passthru()?  Take this, for example:

			/* Allocate memory for the transfer */
			p = kmalloc(sg_size, GFP_KERNEL);
			...
			//TODO 64bit fix
			sg[i].addr_bus = virt_to_bus(p);

That looks distinctly dodgy.  virt_to_bus() returns a 64-bit address, and as
far as I know you may not assume that it will return a 32-bit address.  You're
taking the bus-address of a piece of RAM, but there may be more than 4GB of
RAM in the system.
