Thanks for the patch-set!

This appears to be unused?

This is my fault.  The check is redundant so you can remove it.
I'll kill it in shash too.

Actually I was thinking of separate alloc functions for compress
and decompress so that

1) We know what the user wants to do without every algorithm
reinventing their own signalling for it;

2) The parameters can be separated.

Also, this is something that we'll potentially export to user-space,
so we need to ensure that it is invariant to word length.

So something like this would be good

	int (*setup_comp)(struct crypto_pcomp *tfm, const void *params,
			  unsigned int length);
	int (*setup_decomp)(struct crypto_pcomp *tfm, const void *params,
			    unsigned int length);

The actual parameters should be formatted using the netlink helpers
(nla_*).  So each parameter that you want to set should show up as
a netlink attribute.  If a paramter is absent then you'd just use
the default, etc.

That should be struct crypto_pcomp.

That's the old way to allocate tfm's which won't work since pcomp
is using the new type API.  You should do it the way that shash
does it.
