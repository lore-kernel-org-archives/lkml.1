Think what you want and do what you want. You can even filter out all 
e-mails from me, that's your right. But:

1. As I wrote grouping threads into a single IO context doesn't explain 
all the performance difference and finding out reasons for other's 
performance problems isn't something I can afford at the moment.

2. CFQ doesn't have any processing latency and has never had. Learn to 
understand what are your writing about and how to correctly express 
yourself at first. You asked about that latency and I replied that there 
is nothing to defeat.

3. SCST doesn't have any hooks into CFQ and not going to have in the 
considerable future.
