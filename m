There were 3 changesets upstream, one for each fs; I copied the
changelog from the ext4 changeset because it's the patch that I
originally authored, and combined it with the ext2 & ext3 changes as well.

The upstream ext4 changelog happened to contain some color commentary
from Ted; the ext2 & ext3 changelogs did not.

I don't really give a damn what the stable changelog says, and
personally my feelings won't be hurt with either text, I'll just be
happy to have the bug fixed in -stable.

Thanks,
-Eric
