Hi Balbir,

Trying iozone might be a good idea for analyzing the performance impact
of io controller patches but it might not be the best thing to test
fairness.

The biggest reason being that IO controller provides fairness only if
there is constant contention between the groups. If one group goes away
for sometime, other gets to use the disk full. Now while running above
benchmark, there are numerous occasions where disk is not contended for
and we don't see fairness numbers in user space.

I would recommend trying out fio or small tests to begin with which
can create continuously backlogged queues at the disk to see how 
accurate the io-controller is.

Weight range is 1-1000. I will update documentation to reflect this.
Thanks for pointing it out.
