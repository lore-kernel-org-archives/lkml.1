Thanks now I understand

OK So back to the patch.

As I said scsi_req_map_sg() will go away the same day scsi_execute_async
will. So this patch does only half a job. You Better past it into your
files, and don't patch scsi_lib.

And about the other two in related to this code. They are not enough,
you will have to go deep and wide. You only carry scatterlist pointers
everywhere and only the callers that have a kernel pointer do sg_init_one()
and call down the API with scatterlist pointer. So for example in this patch
the pscsi_map_task_non_SG is dropped. Specifically pt->pscsi_buf will be
pt->pscsi_sg and I'm sure that goes deep into plugins territory.

I hope I got this code right, I only looked at the patches you sent.
Next week I promise to look at the full source code, you stated above,
and review.

Boaz
