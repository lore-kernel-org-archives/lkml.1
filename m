They might be "clear" but I'm not convinced that they are "correct".

These two paragraphs are contradictory.  There is no sense in which a
RAID chunk size is a preferred minimum I/O size.

To some degree it is actually a 'maximum' preferred size for random
IO.  If you do random IO is blocks larger than the chunk size then you
risk causing more 'head contention' (at least with RAID0 - with RAID5
the tradeoff is more complex).

If you are talking about "alignment", then yes - the chunk size is an
appropriate size to align on.  But so are the block size and the
stripe size and none is, in general, any better than any other.


Also, you say "may" report.  If a device does not report, what happens
to this file.  Is it not present, or empty, or contain a special
"undefined" value?
I think the answer is that "512" is reported.  It might be good to
explicitly document that.

In this case, if a device does not report an optimal size, the file
contains "0" - correct?  Should that be explicit?

I'd really like to see an example of how you expect filesystems to use
this.
I can well imagine the VM or elevator using this to assemble IO
requests in to properly aligned requests.  But I cannot imagine how
e.g mkfs would use it.
Or am I misunderstanding and this is for programs that use O_DIRECT on
the block device so they can optimise their request stream?

Thanks,
NeilBrown
