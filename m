Block layer currently doesn't know when a request is actually being
issued.  For timeout, blk_add_timer() can be exported but I think that
only aggravate the already highly fragmented block layer interface
(different users use it differently to the point of scary chaos).  For
minor example, block tracing considers elv_next_request() as the command
issue point which isn't quite true for SCSI and many other drivers.  For
that too, we can export the tracing interface but I don't think that's
the right direction.  More stuff are scheduled to be moved to block
layer and exporting more and more implementation details to block layer
users will have hard time scaling.

I'm trying to convert all drivers to use the same command issue model -
elv_next_request() -> blkdev_dequeue_request() on actual issue ->
blk_end_request().  I have first draft of the conversion patchset but
it's gonna take me a few more days to review and test what I can as
several drivers (mostly legacy ones) are a bit tricky.

For the time being, SCSI layer is the only block layer timeout user and
completion w/o dequeuing is only for error cases in SCSI, so the
inefficiency there shouldn't matter too much.

Jens, what do you think?

Thanks.
