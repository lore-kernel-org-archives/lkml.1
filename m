I'm not too worried about the "single IO producer" scenarios, and it
looks like (from a quick look) that most of your numbers are within some
expected noise levels. It's the more complex mixes that are likely to
cause a bit of a stink, but lets worry about that later. One quick thing
would be to read eg 2 or more files sequentially from disk and see how
that performs.

If you could do a cleaned up version of your overload patch based on
this:

http://git.kernel.dk/?p=linux-2.6-block.git;a=commit;h=1d2235152dc745c6d94bedb550fea84cffdbf768

then lets take it from there.
