Yes.  And it seems to me that you get unfortunate outcomes if you have a 
Pr->Vz->Vr transition.

Yes, reusing Ur pages might well be better, but who knows - they've 
probably got an instruction which makes Uz cheap...

Stuff like this suggets that both parts of the state are packed 
together, and are guest-visible:

+	return (state & ESSA_USTATE_MASK) == ESSA_USTATE_VOLATILE &&
+		(state & ESSA_CSTATE_MASK) == ESSA_CSTATE_ZERO;
