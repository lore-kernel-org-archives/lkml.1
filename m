Ahh, that's news to me. I thought userspace originated the umount but
the kernel constructed and sent the corresponding RPC call.

Right.

Yes, I was aware that the inode might be dirtied by another container. I
was thinking that, at least in the case of NFS, it makes sense to report
the node name of the container that did the original mount. Of course
this doesn't address the general RPC client case and, like patch 3, it
makes the superblock solution rather NFS-specific. That brings me to a
basic question: Are there any RPC clients in the kernel that do not
operate on behalf of NFS?

Thanks!
