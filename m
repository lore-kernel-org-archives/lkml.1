  Yes, and this is expected an correct. When we cannot properly finish a
transaction, we have to discard everything in it. A bug would be (and I
think it could currently happen) if we already checkpointed the previous
transaction and then written over block_B new data from the uncommitted
transaction. I think we have to avoid that - i.e., in case we abort the
journal we should not mark buffers dirty when processing the forget loop.
But this is not too serious since fsck has to be run anyway and it will
fix the problems.

  Well, the scenario has to be a bit different (if we need more space than
there is in the journal, we commit the running transaction, do checkpoint
and start a new transaction) but something like what you describe could
happen. But again I think that this is a correct behavior - i.e., discard
all the data in the running transaction when the journal is aborted before
the transaction is properly committed.
