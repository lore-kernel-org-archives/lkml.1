Hi

This is misdesign in generic bio layer and it should be fixed there. I 
think it is blocking barrier support in md-raid1 too. Jens, pls apply the 
attached patch.

Mikulas

----

Move test for not-supported barriers to __make_request.

This test prevents barriers from being dispatched to device mapper
and md.

This test is sensible only for drivers that use requests (such as disk
drivers), not for drivers that use bios.

It is better to fix it in generic code than to make workaround for it
in device mapper and md.
