Virtio is Linux-specific and is not available on older kernels which
our hypervisor/PVSCSI combination does support. Even if we were to use
virtio-like schema in the hypervisor code we would have to re-implement
much of the virtio code for kernels earlier than those shipped in '07
and do the same for other operating systems for no apparent benefit.
The PCI device abstraction is self-contained and works well on Windows,
Linux and other guest operating systems and so it was chosen.
