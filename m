That code _has_ been merged, something like 3 years ago, and is doing
fine, thank you.

The unprivileged mounts code, which we should be discussing, doesn't
change anything about that, except to not require another suid-root
utility.  Many distributions enabling unprivileged mounting by default
_now_, so it's not as if there's some great danger in doing this
slightly differently.

Sure.
