Hi Jan,

Have you tested with -o nodelalloc?  There is apparently a problem
with ext4 when blocksize < pagesize which Aneesh has been working on.
He has been able to reproduce the problem, and theorized that an
earlier version your patch set would address the problem, but it
apparently did not.  See:

	http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13369

... and Aneesh can provide more details.  Aneesh, you might want to
try testing with this latest set and see if you can reproduce the
problem with this set.
