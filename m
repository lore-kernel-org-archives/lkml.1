Yeah thats a hard to answer question, one that I will leave up to others who
have been doing this much longer than I.  My thought is remount-ro is there to
keep you from crashing, so if you have errors=continue then you expect to live
with the consequences.  Course if that bit gets flipped via corruption thats not
good either.  Thanks,
