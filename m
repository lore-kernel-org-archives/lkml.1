It means the filesystem should not be writeable when it is mounted.
This is not the same as saying that the filesystem itself should do no
IO in the course of making that read-only mount available.

I respectfully disagree, see above.

In that case you are mounting the same filesystem uner 2 different
operating systems simultaneously, which is, and always has been, a
recipe for disaster.  Flagging the fs as "mounted already" would
probably be a better solution, though it's harder than it sounds at
first glance.

Under all conditions it should be safe to mount a read-only block
device, but that is not the same as mounting a filesystem read-only.
