It's really a bug that we're returning an error at all from this point
in the code, so the new client mount code includes a workaround for this
case, added with the code that attempts v4 first by default.

The error we're returning was also wrong.  Unfortunately, my patch to
fix the error went in at around the same time the new mount code went
into nfs-utils, and we communicated poorly about the change.

So:
	- I'm reverting the server patch.  I'd like to reinstate it
	  eventually, depending on how widespread the new mount code
	  was.
	- We'll also make the mount workaround more robust.
	- Most importantly, we need to stamp out the cases where the
	  server hits this error.

--b.
