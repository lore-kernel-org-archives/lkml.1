Norman,
I'm not sure what version or distro of Linux you have
but I just did this quick test on Ubuntu 9.04 in which
a kernel tick seems to be around 4 milliseconds:

$  uname -a
Linux zink 2.6.28-11-generic #42-Ubuntu SMP Fri Apr 17 01:57:59 UTC 2009 i686 
GNU/Linux
$
$ modprobe scsi_debug delay=1000
$ lsscsi -g
[7:0:0:0]    disk    Linux    scsi_debug       0004  /dev/sdb   /dev/sg2

$ time sg_readcap /dev/sg2
Read Capacity results:
    Last logical block address=16383 (0x3fff), Number of blocks=16384
    Logical block length=512 bytes
Hence:
    Device size: 8388608 bytes, 8.0 MiB, 0.01 GB

real	0m3.999s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.000s
$


See 'modinfo scsi_debug' for more about the arguments to the
scsi_debug driver. If the delay is too long then the kernel
may timeout registering the pseudo device. I picked 4 seconds
because you noted a failure above 3 seconds. The timeout on
sg_inq is set at 60 seconds.
