Well, it's an ongoing debate.  Old school kernel coders believe that
infrastructure should be resisted: you implement what you need to, then
if it turns out to be generically useful you put it somewhere that the
second user can access it.

Otherwise we end up with unused infrastructure, or overspecialized
infrastructure which doesn't actually meet the general need.  local_t
displays both these properties.

I can be convinced, but I'll need more than speculation.  Assuming
local_long_atomic_t, can you produce a patch which uses it somewhere else?

OK, you lost me here.  I don't see a memory barrier in the powerpc atomic
ops.  Is there an implied one I missed?

Is this correct?

Erk... no, renaming one to two is bad enough.  Changing the semantics of
one and introducing three more is horrible.

If we're going to rename, I'd choose local_counter_t and local_atomic_t
(both long: I don't think there's a real penalty is there?).

Thanks,
Rusty.
