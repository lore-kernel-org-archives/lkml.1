I'm talking "by design" here.

I will lose data even on SATA drive that is properly powered on if I
wait 5 years.

I can promise you that running S-ATA drive will also lose you data,
even if you are not actively writing to it. Just wait 10 years; so
what is your point?

But ext3 is _designed_ to preserve fsynced data on SATA drive, while
it is _not_ designed to preserve fsynced data on MD RAID5.

Do you really think that's not a difference?

No, because you'll actually repair the ext2 with fsck after the kernel
crash or power outage. Data loss will not be equivalent; in particular
you'll not lose data writen _after_ power outage to ext2.
