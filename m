What regression?  The 32 bit queue depth has always been 256 since 2005
(when it was reduced from 512) ... it's never been 127.

But we have two bug reports for all of the aacraids over the last five
years ... the patch would reduce the maximum transfer length from 128k
to 63.5k.

Linux tends to send down the largest transfer size it can, suggesting
that most of the aacraids in the field are happy with 128k.

The maximum transfer length critically impacts I/O throughput and
performance ... I can't just penalise everyone for the sake of two bug
reports.

This value can already be altered on the fly using the

/sys/block/<dev>/queue/max_sectors_kb

Setting that should work for the two reporters without impacting anyone
else.
