Indeed, this cannot work. syscall_get_nr() requires that it is called on
a call chain that includes do_syscall_trace_enter(). And the fix for it
is not trivial. Probably the best would be to add another field to
pt_regs which contains the system call number. syscall_get_arguments()
could be improved to always use orig_gpr2 instead of grps[2] then it
doesn't matter when it is called. The problematic one is
syscall_set_arguments(), there it depends if grps[2] needs to be stored
of not. Hmm, this needs some thinking ..
Good spotting by the way :-)
