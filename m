Have you tested for any performance regressions as a result of this
patch, using some file system benchmarks?

I don't think this is the best way to fix this problem, though.  The
real right answer is to change how the code is structued.  All of the
callsites that call mpage_da_submit_io() are immediately preceeded by
mpage_da_map_blocks().  These two functions should be combined and
instead of calling ext4_writepage() for each page,
mpage_da_map_and_write_blocks() should make a single call to
submit_bio() for each extent.  That should far more CPU efficient,
solving both your scheduling latency issue as well as helping out for
benchmarks that strive to stress both the disk and CPU simultaneously
(such as for example the TPC benchmarks).

This will also make our blktrace results much more compact, and Chris
Mason will be very happy about that!
