Right, that was the plan.  I wasn't really going to stand there and pull
the plug.  :)  I'd like to get to "out of $NUMBER power-loss events
under this usage, I saw $THIS corruption $THISMANY times ..."

Well, I think it is worth testing through the filesystem, different
journaling mechanisms will probably react^wcorrupt in different ways.

... and those with flux capacitors.  ;)  I've heard of this mechanism
but I'm  not sure I believe it is present in any modern drive.  Not sure
the seagates of the world will tell us, either ....

I suppose we could go about it 2 ways; come up with something diabolical
and  try very hard to break it (I think we know that we can) or do
something more realistic (like untarring & building a kernel?) and see
what happens in that case...

heh,  reminds me of xfs's "osyncisosync" option ;)

FWIW...  md also only does it on raid1... but lvm with a single device
or mirror underneath really *should* IMHO...

hehe, I'll try ... ;)

Well it all depends on what you're testing (and the hardware you're
testing it on).  Between ext3 & xfs you can find plenty of tests which
will show either one or the other as faster.  And most benchmark results
out there probably don't state whether barriers were in force or not.

It certainly does come into play in benchmarking scenarios...
