Yep.  The frequency of modification of fbc->count is of the order of a
tenth or a hundredth of the frequency of
precpu_counter_<modification>() calls.

But in many cases the frequency of percpu_counter_read() calls is far
far less than this.  For example, the percpu_counter_read() may only
happen when userspace polls a /proc file.
