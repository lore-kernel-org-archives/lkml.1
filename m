And that's a good thing since that's exactly what users expect from
sshd : to give up the connection when something goes wrong. I wouldn't
trust a sshd with the ability to initiate connections on its own...

And anyway, I still don't see the scenario where C/R a sshd is useful...
Please someone (Alexey ?), provide a detailed use case where people
would want to checkpoint or migrate live TCP connections... Discussion
on containers@ is very interesting but really lacks of
what-is-the-bigger-picture arguments... These huge patchsets are very
tricky and intrusive... who wants them mainline ? what's the use of
C/R ?

HPC jobs are definitely good candidates.

Yes.
