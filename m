Add interface between cgroups subsystem management and module loading

From: Ben Blum <bblum@andrew.cmu.edu>

This patch implements rudimentary module-loading support for cgroups - namely,
a cgroup_load_subsys (similar to cgroup_init_subsys) for use as a module
initcall, and a struct module pointer in struct cgroup_subsys.

Several functions that might be wanted by modules have had EXPORT_SYMBOL added
to them, but it's unclear exactly which functions want it and which won't.
