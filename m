Cool.  I'll take a look.

Okay.

There was another problem.  If we use blk_rq_map_kern() the failed rq
must be finished after the sense rq is finished because that's when
the bio is copied back if it was copied.  Before sense_rq completion,
the sense buffer doesn't contain any valid data.

Anyways, I'll review your patchset and integrate it with mine.  Please
standby a bit.

Thanks.
