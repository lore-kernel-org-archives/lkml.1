Looks legitimate, although we've been doing that since Linux 2.6.0-test3
(selinux merge) for inode_alloc_security and d_instantiate, and since
Linux 2.6.14 for inode_init_security, so something is at least
triggering it more easily now.  inode_doinit_with_dentry looks like
another instance and security_context_to_sid_core as well.
