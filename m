I attached a backport of the patch from Tony (added as cc) that is in 
2.6.25-rc2. Could you try it out against 2.6.24.2 just to make sure it 
was this patch, then we can send it to stable.

>From Tony Battersby:

When sending a SCSI command to a tape drive via the SCSI Generic (sg)
driver, if the command has a data transfer length more than
scatter_elem_sz (32 KB default) and not a multiple of 512, then I either
hit BUG_ON(!valid_dma_direction(direction)) in dma_unmap_sg() or else
the command never completes (depending on the LLDD).

When constructing scatterlists, the sg driver rounds up the scatterlist
element sizes to be a multiple of 512.  This can result in
sum(scatterlist lengths) > bufflen.  In this case, scsi_req_map_sg()
incorrectly sets bio->bi_size to sum(scatterlist lengths) rather than to
bufflen.  When the command completes, req_bio_endio() detects that
bio->bi_size != 0, and so it doesn't call bio_endio().  This causes the
command to be resubmitted, resulting in BUG_ON or the command never
completing.

This patch makes scsi_req_map_sg() set bio->bi_size to bufflen rather
than to sum(scatterlist lengths), which fixes the problem.
