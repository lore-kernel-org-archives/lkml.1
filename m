Ryo,

Why is it that you repeatedly ignore concern/discussion about your
determination to continue using a custom grouping mechanism?  It is this
type of excess layering that serves no purpose other than to facilitate
out-of-tree use-cases.  dm-ioband would take a big step closer to being
merged upstream if you took others' feedback and showed more willingness
to work through the outstanding issues.
