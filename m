Sure. But that does not answer my question about what to do with
options that can't be changed. Options can come from more than just
/etc/fstab - they can come from the mount command line itself as
entered by the admin. What do we do if an option is specified that
we do not support in a remount?

The problem is the way mount combines command line options with
options in fstab. I'm not questioning what you did - I'm asking what
the expected behaviour is supposed to be so we can make it behave
the same way as all the other filesystems.

Use the full device/directory syntax for the remount command and it
will do just that. The command you issued was not a "pure" remount,rw,
it was silently changed by mount....

Cheers,

Dave.
