My concern would be that such extra-space reuse would be a very
non-obvious performance hit if allocation patterns changed slightly.
If being able to use the extra space really is a noticeable "big win"
for the rare case, then minor changes to the memory allocator could
dramatically impact performance in a totally nondeterministic way.  If
the change isn't performance-significant in the grand scheme of
things, then the use of ksize() would just be code obfuscation.  On
the other hand if it *is* performance-significant, it should be
redesigned to be able to guarantee that the space is available when it
is needed.
