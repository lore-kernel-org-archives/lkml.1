people aren't objecting to better documentation, they are objecting to 
misleading documentation.

for flash drives the danger is very straightforward (although even then 
you have to note that it depends heavily on the firmware of the device, 
some will loose lots of data, some won't loose any)

a good thing to do here would be for someone to devise a test to show this 
problem, and then gather the results of lots of people performing this 
test to see what the commonalities are.

you are generalizing that since you have lost data on flash drives, all 
flash drives are dangerous.

what if it turns out that only one manufacturer is doing things wrong? you 
will have discouraged people from using flash drives for no reason. 
(potentially causing them to loose data becouse they ae scared away from 
using flash drives and don't implement anything better)

to be safe, all that a flash drive needs to do is to not change the FTL 
pointers until the data has fully been recorded in it's new location. this 
is probably a trivial firmware change.


for raid arrays, we are still learning the nuances of what actually can 
happen. the comment that Rik made a few hours ago when he pointed out that 
with raid 5 you won't trash the entire stripe (which is what I thought 
happened from prior comments), but instead run the risk of loosing two 
relativly definable chunks of data

1. the block you are writing (which you can loose anyway)

2. the block that would live on the disk that is missing.

that drasticly lessens the impact of the problem

I would like to see someone explain what would happen on raid 6, and I 
think that the possibilities that Neil talked about where he said that it 
was possible to try the various combinations and see which ones agree with 
each other would be a good thing to implement if he can do so.

but the super simplified statement you keep trying to make is 
significantly overstating and oversimplifying the problem.
