In full agreement we should try to make it easier.

We implemented it to address some specific performance problems reported by
people using those targets.  So far there hasn't been any pressing need to
implement it for other targets.

All this code is hard - but very useful.  The direction I want to explore when
I finally get some time to work on this is one which will probably make more
use of, and extend, merge_bvec.

We have a hybrid model at the moment - some stuff dealt with top-down, other
stuff bottom-up.  This thread describes just one of several problems related to
this.  In the next incarnation of device-mapper I hope we'll find a way to
eliminate all of them together.  Maybe I'll finally get time later this year to
start working on these ideas properly.
