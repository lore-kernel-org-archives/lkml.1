Hi Ivan,

while I agree that your patch is technically correct, I think I'd
rather like to fix the problematic data length instead of making
the storage server ignore it. There is no need for the
dasd_psf_prssd_data structure to be 16 bytes long as it is only used
for suborders that require 12 bytes. The current layout of that
structure was probably just a mistake. If we ever go to use a
suborder that requires more data, we should either define a further
structure specific to that purpose or find some other way to make
sure that each suborder is called with the appropriate data length.

The following patch works fine on current hardware. Can you please
verify that it indeed fixes your problem as well?
