When I first saw the messages I almost got a heart attack, especially 
because I also got an fsck for the file systems on them. Luckily it 
turned out later that the reason for that was that I'd accidentally 
removed the rtc driver from my config, so the fsck was triggered by the 
system clock not being set :-/

OK. If it does turn out to be benign, then I'd suggest marking the 
messages "info: " instead of "warning: ". With "warning" admins would 
still be given the idea that something might be desperately wrong and 
action should be taken NOW.
Personally, I'd even prefer just not to know, unless it for example has a 
major effect on performance _and_ is easily fixable using lvm2.

Wouldn't it be much more logical if the userspace tools warn about 
alignment problems when volumes are _created_?

The volumes were all created using Debian Installer's partitioning 
component, which uses libparted and lvm2.

I'm afraid those files don't exist on my systems (none of them: arm, s390 
and x86_64 notebook). Some kernel config option I'm missing maybe?

Here's the partition layout:

There's only the one PV.

The above is all for the arm system.
