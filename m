Hi all,

I was off those days due to a long holiday here in Brazil. Now I am 
getting back to it.

Vlad, how do you think we should move on it?
Do you want me to try to go deeper on it and make a new plan/propose or 
would you like to reformulate the RFC you did?

As you all know my knowledge still limited on this subject so I don't 
feel comfortable to make this sort of decisions at this moments.
