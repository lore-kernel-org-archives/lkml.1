Should not.  This is just a way to trace a particular process. Currently 
it traces all processes. If we wrap, then we trace the process with the 
new pid. This should not be an issue.

Nope, we can not call that in this context. ftrace_pid_func is called 
directly from mcount, without any protection.

struct pid *find_get_pid(pid_t nr)
{
	struct pid *pid;

	rcu_read_lock();
	pid = get_pid(find_vpid(nr));
	rcu_read_unlock();

	return pid;
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(find_get_pid);

This means find_get_pid will call mcount which will call ftrace_pid_func, 
and back again. This can also happen with rcu_read_{un}lock() and 
get_pid() and find_vpid().

We can not do anything special here.
