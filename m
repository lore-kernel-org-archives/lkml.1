Something like 

if (sizeof(blah) > 4) {
   do all the assignments with shifts
}

might be slighly better since the CDB is already zeroed
by cmd_alloc() and doesn't need to be zeroed a 2nd time.

It's not such a bad option.  The sizeof() test is compile time
determinable, so the compiler simply zeros the fields in the
CONFIG_LBD=n case and does the shift for CONFIG_LBD=y.  It certainly
never compiles to four inline condition checks.
