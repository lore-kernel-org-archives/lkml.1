I think this is more complex. I think you can't just move the last 
directory block to one earlier because that would change the order of 
things in the directory, messing up things that do a partial readdir of 
the directory and then come back to pick up where they left off. you would 
need to move all blocks after the empty up one.

Another thing, you don't nessasarily want to do this movement immediatly 
when a directory block becomes empty. It's very possible that the user is 
deleting a lot of things from the directory, and so may delete enough 
stuff so that all (or almost all) of the directory blocks could be deleted 
through the 'last block in the directory' method. it may be that the best 
thing to do at this point is to wait for instructions from the user to do 
this (more below)

this sounds like something that's best implemented as a nighly cron job 
(run similar to updatedb) to defrag the directory blocks. given changes 
over the years to disk technology (both how much slower seeks have become 
relative to sequential reads on rotating media, and how SSDs really have 
much larger block sizes internally than what's exposed to users), it may 
make sense to consider having a defrag tool for the data blocks as well.
