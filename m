Very nice summary of the problems we are trying to address here,

No, we should not push this kind of thing down to the lower drivers.

In fact, my goal is to try to keep a "normal" driver writer from having
to know anything about the driver model, except for how to add and
remove a sysfs file that is bound to the device controlled by the
driver.

And for the majority of the busses, this is true, it's only people like
you who are mucking around in the bus specific code that know how hard
this whole thing is :)

I agree, that should be our goal.  And for almost all busses, this is
true today, right?

Why would kobject_get become heavier?

Yes, but you have to watch out for devices that add their own files with
callbacks to that driver.  That is a problem today that Oliver has tried
to address with his recent patches.

No, the majority of the logic is in the busses, and we can update them
pretty easily.

I'd be interested in seeing how we can do this.  Do you have any
specific patches started in this area?

Well, remember, module unloading is racy and unrecommended to use anyway
:)

Also, look at the network drivers who all have their own special type of
lock, with no module reference count increment when they are in use.  Is
this what you want to do for everything else?

Well, kobject was created because Al Viro wanted to use them for the
block devices and it didn't make sense to use a 'struct device' for them
at the time.  Also, the class code wasn't even around then (this is
_very_ early 2.5 timeframe.

So yes, any cleanups and refactoring that we can do in this area would
be very good and welcome.  Kay has had some ideas for how we can clean
up the whole subsystem/kset mess too.  Hopefully something comes of that
soon.

thanks,
