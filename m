Good catch. But no ... and I had to study this a bit. Bear with me:

It is enough to call init_completion() once, and not once per use:
it initializes spinlocks, which shouldn't be intialized twice. 

But, that completion might be used multiple times when there are
multiple errors, and so, before using it a second time, one must 
set completion->done = 0.  The INIT_COMPLETION() macro does this. 

One must have completion->done = 0 before every use, as otherwise, 
wait_for_completion() won't actually wait. And since complete_all()
sets x->done += UINT_MAX/2, I'm pretty sure x->done won't be zero
the next time we use it, unless we make it so.

So I need to find a place to safely call INIT_COMPLETION() again, 
after the completion has been used. At the moment, I'm stumped
as to where to do this. 

---- [think ... think ... think] ----

I think the race you describe above is harmless. The first time
that sym_eh_handler() will run, it will be with SYM_EH_ABORT, 
in it doesn't matter if we lose that, since the device is hosed
anyway. At some later time, it will run with SYM_EH_DEVICE_RESET
and then SYM_EH_BUS_RESET and then SYM_EH_HOST_RESET, and we won't 
miss those, since, by now, sym2_io_error_detected() will have run.

So, by my reading, I'd say that init_completion() in
sym2_io_error_detected() has to stay (although perhaps
it should be replaced by the INIT_COMPLETION() macro.)
Removing it will prevent correct operation on the second 
and subsequent errors.
