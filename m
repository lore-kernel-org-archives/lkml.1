Ok yes, this one is the 2nd rev of the original patch to remove the
usage of scsi_execute_async().  The other two are for getting rid of the
casts in between target_core_mod se_task_t scatterlist memory and
mapping into target core subsystem plugins (PSCSI, IBLOCK, FILEIO)
following your recommendations.

Ok, here commit diffs for the three patches that affect target_core_mod:

[PATCH] [Target_Core_Mod/PSCSI]: Use struct request to struct scsi_device->request_queue

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/nab/lio-core-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=1b14b5e1fc9a7074322b1015bb86eca2a8ef4560

[PATCH] [Target_Core_Mod]: Convert to se_task_t->task_sg usage in core and subsystem plugins

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/nab/lio-core-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=41e98940da5ffaf7e31fce8d1f706e3e0a679654

[PATCH] [Target_Core_Mod]: Update PSCSI, IBLOCK, FILEIO and RAMDISK for se_task_t->task_sg

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/nab/lio-core-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=e030ca2b9bbb81402b3ed669bb5e1d54fed0dff7

Ok, these patches are against the development lio-core-2.6.git (v3.0)
tree (currently at v2.6.28-rc7) which tracks linux-2.6.git.  I will be
sure to include this in futher postings.  

Also, I am posting the patches related to the generic target core
(target_core_mod) and plugins that hook into Linux storage subsystems
(PSCSI, IBLOCK, FILEIO) to start getting some feedback on the current
work in the v3.0 development tree.  The code in
lio-core-2.6.git/drivers/lio-core is the ConfigFS enabled generic target
engine, subsystem plugins, and traditional LIO iSCSI target engine that
will be submitted for upstream inclusion (most likely in that order) as
work continues, sometime in the v2.6.29 timeframe.

Many thanks for your comments,
