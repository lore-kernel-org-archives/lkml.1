Andrew, Neil,

The stripe-queue patches are showing solid performance improvement.

Dan Williams (2):
      raid5: add the stripe_queue object for tracking raid io requests (take2)
      raid5: use stripe_queues to prioritize the "most deserving" requests (take4)

I initially considered them 2.6.24 material but after fixing the sync+io
data corruption regression, fixing the large 'stripe_cache_size' values
performance regression, and seeing how well it performed on my IA
platform I would like them to be considered for 2.6.23.  That being said
I have not yet tested expand operations or raid6.

Without any tuning a 4 disk (SATA) RAID5 array can reach 190MB/s.  Previously
performance was around 90MB/s.  Blktrace data confirms that less reads are
occurring and more writes are being merged.

$ mdadm --create /dev/md0 /dev/sd[abcd] -n 4 -l 5 --assume-clean
$ blktrace /dev/sd[abcd] &
$ for i in `seq 1 3`; do dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/md0 bs=1024k count=1024; done
$ fg ^C
$ blkparse /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd

Andrew, please add this git tree to -mm.  Neil, if you are comfortable with the
current state please ack and I will send a last minute pull request for 2.6.23.

Thanks,
Dan
