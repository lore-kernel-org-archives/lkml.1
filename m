Ok, that makes sense.

As I'm continuing to dig, I took a look at the x86 side of the 
house and they have this interesting sequence:

cpu_disable_common()
	remove_cpu_from_maps()  /* remove cpu from online map */
	fixup_irqs()
		[break irq-CPU affinity]

		local_irq_enable();
		mdelay(1);
		local_irq_disable();
                
So in x86, we allow interrupt handlers to run on a CPU that's 
already been removed from the online map.

Does that seem like an analagous situation to what we have in
ia64?

Thanks.

/ac, still digging
