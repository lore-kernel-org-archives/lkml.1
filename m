Link down is an indication of path connectivity loss, and connectivity loss is
one one of the tasks of the transport - to isolate the upper layers from
transient loss.  Mike's addition was appropriate as it changed the way i/o was
dealt with while in one of the transient loss states.

But interpretation of an i/o completion status is a very different matter. The
transport/LLDD shouldn't be making any inferences based on i/o completion
state. That's for upper layers who better know the device and the task at hand
to decide. The transport is simply tracking connectivity status *as driven by
the LLDD*.

So, although I can understand that you would like to use latency as a path
quality issue, I don't agree with making the transport be the one making a
failover policy, even if the feature is optional. Failover policy choice is
for the multipathing software.

Can you give me a reason why it is not addressed in multipathing layers ? Why
isn't the upper layer monitoring latency, which doesn't have to be an i/o
timeout, not tracked in the multipathing software.  The additional advantage
of doing this (at the right level) is that this failover due to latency on a
path, would apply to all transports.

In order to agree to such a patch, I would need to know, very clearly, what an
LLDD is supposed to do in a "transient error" handler.  This was unspecified.

I have a hard time agreeing with a default policy that says, just because a
single i/o timed out, the entire target topology tree should be torn down. Due
to the reasons for a timeout, it may require more than 1 before a pattern
exists that says it should be considered "bad".  Mostly though - the topology
tree is there to represent the connectivity on the FC fabric *as seen by the
LLDD* and largely tracks to the LLDD discovery and login state.  Asynchronous
teardown of this tree by an i/o timeout can leave a mismatch in the transport
vs LLDD on the rport state (perhaps causing other errors) as well as forcing a
condition where OS tools/admins viewing the sysfs tree - see a colored view of
what the fabric connectivity actually is.

Additionally, I think it's very odd to have a single i/o, which timed out,
kill all other i/o's to all luns on that target. Given array implementations
that may make lun relationships vary greatly (with preferred paths,
distributed controller implementations), this is too broad a scope to imply.

All of this is solved if you deal with it at the "device" level in the
multipathing software.

Then it hints the error handler should be fixed....
