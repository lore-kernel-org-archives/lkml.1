The error indicates that the adapter did not respond to a basic port reset,
which we do before we try to bring up it's messaging interface, etc.
This likely means it failed POST or some other hardware error. The LED's on
the backpanel would have indicated the condition. The LP8000 is a pretty old
board and was EOL'd years ago, so it doesn't surprise me that something like
this could pop up.

As much as any vendor hates to see a customer switch :( I understand expediency...

As an fyi - to help the debug, whether it be Emulex or Qlogic, or someone else,
I recommend that you cat the various /sys/class/scsi_host/hostX/* and
/sys/class/fc_host/hostX/* attributes (where hostX corresponds to the scsi? bus\
number assigned to the adapter).  Assuming the adapter attaches enough for these
things to exist, it will give us a lot more information about the adapter for debug.
