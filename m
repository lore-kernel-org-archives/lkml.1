Me again,
The controllers do support RC16. After some more work it looks like RC16 is
never getting to the driver. I'm snooping the CDB's of all requests as well
as the completions from the driver and I never see a 0x9e. I do see the
RC10 (0x25) though, so I think my debug is right.

Why would I never the see the command in the driver?
