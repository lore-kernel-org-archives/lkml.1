It is difficult for me to isolate the recent rt scheduler improvement as so many other changes were introduced to the kernel at the same time. A more accurate comparison should just revert the rt-scheduler back to the previous version and test the delta. I am not sure how to get that done. 

>2) how many rt tasks?   
	Around 250 rt tasks.

>3) what were the prios, producer compared to consumers, not actual numbers
	I suppose the single log writer is the main producer (rt-prio 49, higheset rt-prio in this workload) which wake up all foreground process when the log write is done. The 240 foreground processes are the consumer (rt-prio 48). At any given time some number of the 240 foreground was waiting for log writer to finish flushing out the log data.

>4) have you tried pinning tasks?

We did try pin foreground rt-process to cpu. That recovered about 1% performance but introduce idle time in some cpu. Without load balancing, my solution is to pin more processes to the idle cpu. I don't think this is a practical solution for the idle time problem as the process distribution need to be adjusted again when upgrade to a different server.
