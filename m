Filled a bugzilla entry, no answer for 3 days, and at same time it is clear 
regression.
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14242

While on 2.6.30.5 MPT SAS controller worked fine, on 2.6.31 it fails on heavy
operations and start spitting errors to dmesg (they vary). Failsystems also
stopped, and i am unable to reboot box properly (only over sysrq or 
hardreset). 

x86, Sun Fire X4100, 8 GB RAM, PAE kernel enabled, module loaded with default
options

I upgrade BIOS, LSI controller BIOS to latest version, it didn't fix the bug.
I cannot do bisection, because this is loaded server and semi-embedded system.
But i can do tests of patches or reverse specific commits, if you point me to
exact commit.

http://www.nuclearcat.com/files/dmesg.ok from 2.6.30.5 kernel
http://www.nuclearcat.com/files/dmesg.fail from 2.6.31.1 kernel
http://www.nuclearcat.com/files/config.gz config from 2.6.31.1 kernel

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Additionally - i have few other similar units (X4100), but with less amount of 
RAM (4GB),HDD's(2 only), less load (but still enough heavy at some moments) 
working ok. I dont think it is hardware issue, since it works on 2.6.30 very 
stable, and worked on other (older) kernels for 1 year and more. It is clear 
regression and i guess dangerous regression (causing data loss on high 
loads). I will try to bisect some changes on mpt driver today. 

Please CC me on answers, i am not subscribed at any SCSI/LSI list.

Crossposting to linux-kernel, since there is no mails about issue from 
linux-scsi.
