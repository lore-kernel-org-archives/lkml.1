Ok, thanks for pointing out that /sys/module/scsi_mod/parameters/wait...
is _wrong_. Could you suggest something that would be _right_?

... does _not_ deserve to be a module, and writing/building a module

does not seem to be the proper way to solve the problem either.

You're almost right here. But IMHO this is simply a case of
doing something in some kernel subsystem in a proper/better
way than it is being done presently.

Anyway, like I said on another thread, discussions here tend to be
most productive only over code, so I'll try and make a patch to do
this some other way.

Thanks,
Satyam
