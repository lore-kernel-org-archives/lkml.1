The panic backtrace is just some random kernel page fault or general
protection fault, because the freed pointer is not the allocated one.

Yes. I have a fix by storing real allocated async_req in
async_req->data. Can you help me to review that?

Yes. Now AES-NI uses it. And because a Per-CPU thread implementation is
used for cryptd, it can be used to speedup dm-crypt in some situation
too I think.
