commit e6957ea48429aeda4f5d51af4238231d44b0dc4a
Author: Eric Sandeen <sandeen@sandeen.net>

    [XFS] Ensure "both" features2 slots are consistent
    
    Since older kernels may look in the sb_bad_features2 slot for flags,
    rather than zeroing it out on fixup, we should make it equal to the
    sb_features2 value.
    
    Also, if the ATTR2 flag was not found prior to features2 fixup, it was not
    set in the mount flags, so re-check after the fixup so that the current
    session will use the feature.
    
    Also fix up the comments to reflect these changes.

    [XFS] Fix superblock features2 field alignment problem
    
    Due to the xfs_dsb_t structure not being 64 bit aligned, the last field of
    the on-disk superblock can vary in location This causes problems when the
    filesystem gets moved to a different platform, or there is a 32 bit
    userspace and 64 bit kernel.
    
    This patch detects the defect at mount time, logs a warning such as:
    
    XFS: correcting sb_features alignment problem
    
    in dmesg and corrects the problem so that everything is OK. it also
    blacklists the bad field in the superblock so it does not get used for
    something else later on.
