OK. I reversed that change and built and installed the kernel. It has
withstood 100 reboots without a panic. Additionally, I pulled the
latest changes (that will be rc8-git5, I think) from kernel.org,
reversed the change to that kernel and built and installed it. That
too withstood 100 reboots without a panic.

Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help fix this.
