The cpu ops patchset uses per cpu addresses that are not relocated to a
certain processor. The relocation is implicit in these instructions and
must be implicit so these operations can be processor atomic.

Its not worth working on given the state of IA64. I talked to Tony at the
Plumbers conference. It may be beneficial to drop the virtual percpu
mapping entirely because that would increase the number of TLB entries
available.

There is no problem with using unrelocated percpu addresses as an
"address" for the cpu ops. The IA64 "virtual" addresses are a stand in for
the segment registers on IA64.

Dropping the use of the special mapping over time may be the easiest way
to go for IA64. percpu RMW ops like this_cpu_add are not possible with
IA64 since no lightweight primitives exist. We could only avoid the
calculation of the per cpu variables address. Would allow assignment and
access to be atomic but not the RMW instruction. So it would not be a full
per cpu ops implementation anyways.
