Not anticipating on rotation media and letting other group do the dispatch
is not only bad for fairness of random readers but it seems to be bad for
overall throughput also. So letting other group dispatching thinking it
will boost throughput is not necessarily right on rotational media.

I ran following test. Created two groups of weight 100 each and put a 
sequential dd reader in first group and put buffered writers in second
group and let it run for 20 seconds and observed at the end of 20 seconds
which group got how much work done. I ran this test multiple time, while
increasing the number of writers by one each time. Did test this with
dm-ioband and with io scheduler based io controller patches.

Few things stand out.
====================
- With dm-ioband, as number of writers increased, in group 2, it gave
  BW to those writes over reads running in group 1. It had two bad
  effects. First of all read throughput went down secondly overall disk
  throughput also went down.

  So reader did not get fairness at the same time overall throughput went
  down. Hence probably it is not a very good idea to not anticipate and
  always let other groups dispatch on rotational media.

  In contrast, io scheduler based controller seems to be steady and reader
  doest not suffer as number of writers increase in the second group and
  overall disk throughput also remains stable.

Follwoing is the sample script I used for above test.
