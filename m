I applied both of the patches.  The biofill one did not apply cleanly,
as it was adding biofill to one section, and removing it from another,
but it appears that biofill does not need to be removed from a stock
2.6.23 kernel.  The second patch applies with a slight offset, but no
errors.

I can report success so far with both patches applied.  I created an
1100GB RAID5, formated it XFS, and successfully "tar c | tar x" 895GB
of data onto it.  I'm also in the process of rsync-ing the 895GB of
data from the (slightly changed) original.  In the past, I would
always get a hang within 0-50GB of data transfer.

For each drive in the RAID I also:

echo 128 > /sys/block/"$i"/queue/max_sectors_kb
echo 512 > /sys/block/"$i"/queue/nr_requests
echo 1 > /sys/block/"$i"/device/queue_depth
blockdev --setra 65536 /dev/md3
echo 16384 > /sys/block/md3/md/stripe_cache_size

These changes appear to improve performance, along with a RAID5 chunk
size of 1024k, but these changes alone (without the patches) do not
fix the problem.
