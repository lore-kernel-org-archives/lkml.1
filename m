I took a look at MakeIocReady(), and this section caught my eye:

/* Is it already READY? */
if (!statefault && (ioc_state & MPI_IOC_STATE_MASK) == MPI_IOC_STATE_READY)
	return 0;

So I turned on a whole lot more debugging (mpt_debug_level=65535), and
caught this from the dhsprintk() just above that code snippet:

mptbase::MakeIocReady, ioc0 [raw] state=10000000

state=10000000 seems to correspond with MPI_IOC_STATE_READY, which means
that the adapter isn't getting reset because the chip claims to be
ready.  It doesn't seem to be ready, as demonstrated by the original error
message that I reported with the patch.  I'll append the log entries
pertaining to mpt to the end of this message.
