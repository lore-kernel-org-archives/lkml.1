No, the kmsg-doc script will prevent that the kmsg message will become
of of sync and it checks for duplicate numbers. The idea here is that
the kmsg man pages are generated with the kernel compile (just try it
with "make D=2").

Yes, and this has already happened with the s390 device driver messages.
With the conversion to kmsg our developers removed a lot of crud from
the code, this alone makes it worthwhile.
