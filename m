RFC4309 section 8 actually says the test vectors you can use are here:
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3610.txt
in RFC3610 section 8.  I don't think theres anything wrong with the vectors
your're using below, but you may want to add the vectors from 3610 just to
imrpove the testing.

Other than that, looks good.  Thanks for all the hard work!
