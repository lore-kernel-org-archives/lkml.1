The controllers support mandatory commands at least, as the spec says?

I think that there are other areas that we can improve with a SCSI
driver, such as error handling, queue depth management, etc.

I guess that distributions (with HP) can, as they could with libata
vs. ide.

I think that customers don't care about how the driver is
implemented. My point is that the SCSI cciss driver could be better
than the block one.

As James pointed out, we could provide a migration path; we can change
only the driver internal without changing the user-space interfaces:

With my SCSI driver (I uploaded a new one), I got the following
devices connected with my CCISS adapter:

clover:/home/fujita# lsscsi
(snip)
[3:0:0:0]    disk    HP       LOGICAL VOLUME   1.66  /dev/sde
[3:0:0:1]    disk    HP       LOGICAL VOLUME   1.66  /dev/sdf
[3:0:0:2]    disk    HP       LOGICAL VOLUME   1.66  /dev/sdg
[3:0:0:3]    disk    HP       LOGICAL VOLUME   1.66  /dev/sdh

I created symbolic links (neat udev rules can do automatically).

clover:/home/fujita# ls -l /dev/cciss/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 8 2008-07-23 21:38 c0d0 -> /dev/sde
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 2008-07-23 21:39 c0d0p1 -> /dev/sde1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 2008-07-23 21:39 c0d0p2 -> /dev/sde2
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 8 2008-07-23 21:38 c0d1 -> /dev/sdf
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 8 2008-07-23 21:38 c0d2 -> /dev/sdg
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 8 2008-07-23 21:38 c0d3 -> /dev/sdh

The symbolic links enable users to mount the device as before.

hpacucli seems to work (I didn't try all the commands but the point is
that we can provide the ioctl compatibility):

clover:/home/fujita# hpacucli
HP Array Configuration Utility CLI 7.80-3.0
Detecting Controllers...Done.
Type "help" for a list of supported commands.
Type "exit" to close the console.

=> ctrl all show config

Smart Array E200 in Slot 3    (sn: PA6C90L9SV90L0)

      physicaldrive 1I:1:1 (port 1I:box 1:bay 1, SAS, 72 GB, OK)

   array B (SAS, Unused Space: 0 MB)

      logicaldrive 2 (68.3 GB, RAID 0, OK)

      physicaldrive 1I:1:3 (port 1I:box 1:bay 3, SAS, 72 GB, OK)

      logicaldrive 3 (68.3 GB, RAID 0, OK)

      physicaldrive 1I:1:2 (port 1I:box 1:bay 2, SAS, 72 GB, OK)

      logicaldrive 4 (68.3 GB, RAID 0, OK)

      physicaldrive 1I:1:4 (port 1I:box 1:bay 4, SAS, 72 GB, OK)


When HP and distributions think that the scsi driver is ready,
they can modify their udev rules for cciss and enable the SCSI driver
module instead of the block driver.

Yes, I understand that. We will need lots of tests.

As I explained, we can provide the compatibility of ioctl and device
names. We could avoid breaking the existing tools?

Even though we need lots of tests, I still think that migrating to the
SCSI subsystem is the right thing for CCISS in the long term
perspective.

If HP releases its SCSI driver, I'm happy to throw my driver away and
work on HP SCSI driver. I like to see a driver in development rather
than a finished driver; development in mainline rather than private
development at a vendor. Everyone can see the progress and try it.


Thanks,
