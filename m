You have an "__le32 addr2" followed, it might want too in rare cases.
But for me this is also a a declaration issue and a readability issue.

I'm telling the compiler, don't mess with my structure, this needs
to be constant whatever the compiler is. In C the compiler is even
allowed to change fields order if it wants to. Why the guess work,
__packed and be done with it.

And it's also a readability issue. Look above lxd_t vs pxd_t. I can't
know that one is in memory and one is on disk. I have to ask questions
and make wrong remarks. But if the later had a __packed on it, then
there are no more questions.

__packed for me is a statement for both the programmer and compiler
that says: "This stuff will be seen externally of the machine. It must
be universally constant"
