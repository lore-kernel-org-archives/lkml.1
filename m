So how can that happen?

AFAICS, when the pte is dirtied, we should get a page fault, which
causes the page itself to be marked dirty by the nfs_vm_page_mkwrite()
callback.
When the page gets written out, the VM calls clear_page_dirty_for_io()
which also causes the pte to be cleaned.

At what point can you therefore have a situation where the pte is dirty
without the page being marked as dirty too?
