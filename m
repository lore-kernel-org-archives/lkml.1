I agree with this, and the other points you raised that I snipped out.

Ok, this is about the 3rd or 4th time I've heard this, from totally
different people lately.  It seems that I'm the only one that has the
ability to drop drivers out of the kernel tree, which is a funny
situation :)

In thinking about this a lot more, I don't really mind it.  If people
want to push stuff out of "real" places in the kernel, into
drivers/staging/ and give the original authors and maintainers notice
about what is going on, _and_ provide a TODO file for what needs to
happen to get the code back into the main portion of the kernel tree,
then I'll be happy to help out with this and manage it.

I think a 6-9 month window (basically 3 kernel releases) should be
sufficient time to have a driver that has been in drivers/staging/ be
cleaned up enough to move back into the main kernel tree.  If not, it
could be easily dropped.

Any objections to this?

I totally agree.  And so far, it does seem to be working well for this.
A number of companies have used it to successfully get their code into
the main kernel, as well as driving them to clean up their code better
to keep it from having to go into the staging tree.
