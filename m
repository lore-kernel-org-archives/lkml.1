Indeed. John, note that the driver changes aren't related to enabling
some hardware feature. Drivers just need to be converted to use the sg
walker helpers instead of doing it manually, then they'll also gain
larger IO support. The SCSI drivers are currently being transitioned to
that seperately, my patchset just contains patches for remaining drivers
(which include non-SCSI ones as well).

The hardware has to support a big number of segments of course, looking
at aic7xxx it seems to be limited at 128. From the comment that looks
like it can be increased though, see AHD_NSEG in
drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic79xx_osm.h:

/*
 * Number of SG segments we require.  So long as the S/G segments for
 * a particular transaction are allocated in a physically contiguous
 * manner and are allocated below 4GB, the number of S/G segments is
 * unrestricted.
 */
#define AHD_NSEG 128
