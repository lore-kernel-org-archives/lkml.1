With IRQ balance turned off, it did not make any difference.

This time I also left NCQ on (bad idea):

And infact this time (w/NCQ enabled), it was so bad it dropped a disk from

I will try booting with the various options disabling APIC/ACPI/nolapic to see 
if it is possible to not get these errors/problems under heavy I/O:

$ cat runtest.sh 
#!/bin/bash

for i in `seq 0 20`
do
   cd $i
   tar xf ../linux-2.6.25.10.tar &
   cd ..
done

In short, utilizing Raptors (especially veliciraptors)+NCQ on the ICH8 
w/AHCI & other cards in a RAID 5 configuration is a death trap (a good way 
to lose your data), it appears unsafe to use NCQ w/raptors in a RAID 5
configuration.  I've defaulted back to disabling it like I always do
and my RAID5 is rebuilding now.

After the rebuild is completed I will perform more testing.


Justin.
