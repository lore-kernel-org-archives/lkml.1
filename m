For faster random IO I would suggest to use raid10,f2 for the random
reading, it performs like raid0, something like more than double the
speed of a normal single-drive file system. For random writes raid10,f2
performs like most other mirrorred raids, given that data needs to be
written twice.

Try and see if you can gat any HW raids to match that performance.
