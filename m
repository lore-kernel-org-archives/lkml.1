I really feel that the latest information that has come up has indicated 
that things are really not what they should be.  They are in line, have 
a substantial probe cost, and we're messing around with how to jump 
around them.

That's not the problem.

I maintain what I said before: a call instruction (which defaults to a 
NOP), and then extract the state based on debugging info or assembler 
annotations.

As far as patchable static jumps, I can see the utility of them, but I 
don't think this project is one of them.  However, I believe the right 
way to do them is via compiler support.
