What are you talking about? Of course it was possible! What is
the /bar/baz mount example below doing that is specific to NFSv4? The
only difference here is the question of who is interpreting the mount
path.

The precedent is that in NFSv2/v3, the client sent _all_ mount path
lookup requests to the server's mount daemon. The mount daemon then did
a path lookup in its namespace, following symlinks if necessary, and
returned an NFSv2/v3 filehandle for the endpoint.
In all lookup requests that were sent to the NFS server, symlinks were
never followed, but were returned to the NFS client for interpretation
relative to the user's namespace.

In NFSv4, the mount path is looked up by the client. Why should it act
any differently to the NFSv2/v3 mount daemon, and interpret symlinks
relative to some other namespace?
After the mount is complete, then all subsequent lookups are interpreted
relative to the user's namespace, and so are the symlinks.

The mount daemon returns the filehandle of the end point mount path
after interpreting the symlink relative to its namespace. It doesn't
error out.

Why should an NFSv4 mount that uses the exact same mount parameters
suddenly have to return an EINVAL when it could do exactly the same
thing as NFSv2/v3 did?

No! It means that we _always_ interprets mount paths as being relative
to the server namespace, and that we _always_ interprets user path
lookups as being relative to the user's namespace.

That is fully consistent with all previous practice, and means that

1)
    mount -t nfs -overs=2 server:/bar/baz/mnt
    mount -t nfs -overs=3 server:/bar/baz /mnt
and
    mount -t nfs4 server:/bar/baz /mnt

always works and produces the same result. A subsequent
'ls /mnt/symlink' will refer to the resulting user namespace, and so the
symlink may point to a local file or directory

2)
    mount -t nfs -overs=2 server:/bar/baz/symlink /mnt
    mount -t nfs -overs=3 server:/bar/baz/symlink /mnt
and
    mount -t nfs4 server:/bar/baz/symlink /mnt

always produce the same result (but different to case 1). We mount the
directory that 'symlink' points to on the server. A subsequent 'ls /mnt'
shows no symlink, but points to the same NFS mounted directory in all 3
cases.

3)
    mount -t nfs -overs=2 server:/bar/baz/symlink/foo /mnt
    mount -t nfs -overs=3 server:/bar/baz/symlink/foo /mnt
and
    mount -t nfs4 server:/bar/baz/symlink/foo /mnt

always produce the same result (but different to cases 1 and 2). We
mount the same sub-directory of case 2 onto /mnt.

It can't do that. It has no idea whether or not this is a mount path
lookup or a user path lookup, and as I've said before, the two refer to
completely different namespaces.
