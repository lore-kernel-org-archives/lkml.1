 OK, the change happened between rc5 and rc6. Just following a gut feeling, I reverted

#commit 81eabcbe0b991ddef5216f30ae91c4b226d54b6d
#Author: Mel Gorman <mel@csn.ul.ie>

#
#    mm: fix page allocation for larger I/O segments
#    
#    In some cases the IO subsystem is able to merge requests if the pages are
#    adjacent in physical memory.  This was achieved in the allocator by having
#    expand() return pages in physically contiguous order in situations were a
#    large buddy was split.  However, list-based anti-fragmentation changed the
#    order pages were returned in to avoid searching in buffered_rmqueue() for a
#    page of the appropriate migrate type.
#    
#    This patch restores behaviour of rmqueue_bulk() preserving the physical
#    order of pages returned by the allocator without incurring increased search
#    costs for anti-fragmentation.

This has brought back the good results I observed and reported.
I do not know what to make out of this. At least on the systems I care
about (HP/DL380g4, dual CPUs, HT-enabled, 8 GB Memory, SmartaArray6i
controller with 4x72GB SCSI disks as RAID5 (battery protected writeback
cache enabled) and gigabit networking (tg3)) this optimisation is a dissaster.

 On the other hand, it is not a regression against 2.6.22/23. Those had
bad IO scaling to. It would just be a shame to loose an apparently great
performance win.
