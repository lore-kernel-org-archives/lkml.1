Dunno...  The dmesg output is not terribly useful here, because most of
the "interesting" stuff concerning udev startup that appears on the
console never makes it into a log.  Note that, for the bad cases, I
don't see the same console output that Michael reported, although the
net effect is the same: the partitions don't get found, so I'm offered
the chance to enter my root password and do some poking around, and
when I do, none of the block devices are present under /dev.

I'm open to suggestions on how to take this analysis further.  Michael
indicated he's running a conference this week, so I don't know when he'll
be able to come up for air.
