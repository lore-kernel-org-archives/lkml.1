No need to bisect - it was 25d6e2d7c58ddc4a3b614fc5381591c0cfe66556, my
commit that "optimised" 64bit memcpy() for Power6 and Cell.

The bug was in -rc1, but if your copies were 8-byte aligned with respect
to the source the problem wouldn't have been seen... Could this have
been why you didn't see it in -rc5?

I'll work on a fix now.

Thanks!

Mark
