I've released a new patchset for post-2.6.26-git4 kernels (when Linus
accepted a set of patches for the 2.6.27-rc1 merge window).  A number of
the new patches are cleanups and bug fixes that will be pushed to Linus
shortly; those are marked with an (*).

As a git tree:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4.git 2.6.26-git6-ext4-1
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4.git;a=shortlog;h=2.6.26-git6-ext4-1

As a patchset:

ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/tytso/ext4-patches/2.6.26-git6-ext4-1

					----

I've also created a patchset which consists of the new features and bug
fixes pushed to linus, plus the bug fixes and cleanups that are part of
2.6.26-git6-ext4-1 for people who are running the stock 2.6.26 kernel.
This can be found here:

ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/tytso/ext4-patches/2.6.26-git6-ext4-3

This patchset plus e2fsprogs 1.41.0 should be stable enough for wider
testing.
