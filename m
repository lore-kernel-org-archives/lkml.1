I think we got all caught up arguing about the other patches in the
batch (the last round of the everlasting  "dynamic nfsd management for
Linux" argument) and between us we managed to drop the patch on the ground.

I think the only part of that patchset that you explicitly rejected was
the one where I tried to kill off the useless "th" line in
/proc/net/rc/nfsd.
