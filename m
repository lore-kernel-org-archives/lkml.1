It looks liks AS and CFQ both care about the "sync" bit; they both use
rq_is_sync defined in include/lonux/blkdev.h.  Deadline apparently
only distinguishes between read and write requests, and not whether
they are considered synchronous or not.  The noop scheduler, obviously
also doesn't care.  :-)

Well, if the deadline scheduler ignores the SYNC bit, it would still
make sense for it to only unplug the queue after for the commit block,
and not for any of the other writes to the journal.  Unplugging after
every synchronous write is going to lead to a performance problem,
which I've demonstrated using the fopen/fprintf/fsync/fclose scenario
that Jens pointed me at.
