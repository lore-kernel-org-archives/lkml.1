  As Mingming pointed out there are few other places where we could hold
the bh reference. Note also that we accumulate references to buffers in the
wbuf[] list and we need that for submit_bh() which consumes one bh
reference. Generally, it seems to me as a too fragile and impractical
rule "nobody can hold bh reference when not holding page lock" which is
basically what it comes down to if you really want to be sure that
journal_try_to_free_buffers() succeeds. And also note that in principle
there are other places which hold references to buffers without holding the
page lock - for example writepage() in ordered mode (although this one is
in practice hardly triggerable). So how we could fix at least the races
with commit code is to implement launder_page() callback for ext3/4 which
would wait for the previous transaction commit in case the page has buffers
that are part of that commit (I don't want this logic in
journal_try_to_free_buffers() as that is called also on memory-reclaim
path, but journal_launder_page() is fine with me). This would be correct
but could considerably slow down O_DIRECT writes in cases they're mixed
with buffered writes so I'm not sure if this is acceptable.
  OTOH with the ordered mode rewrite patch, the problem with commit code
also goes away since there we don't need extra references to data buffers
(we use just filemap_fdatawrite).
