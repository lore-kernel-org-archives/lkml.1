OK, this is what I did:

Split the set into 3, in the following order:

CORE -> DRIVERS -> ARCH

So that's 3 branches, core is based off master, drivers off core, and
arch off drivers. I'll push core+drivers into #for-akpm for testing,
then the arch bits will stay undisturbed until acked by maintainers.
