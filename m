There isn't OOM in both cases. Just pages reclamation/readahead work 
much better in the buffered case.

Sure, the mmap() approach agreed to be unpractical, but could you 
elaborate more on this anyway, please? I'm just curious. Do you think 
about implementing a new syscall, which would put pages with data in the 
mmap'ed area?

No, that isn't off topic. We've just proved that there is no good way to 
implement zero-copy cached I/O for STGT. I see the only practical way 
for that, proposed by FUJITA Tomonori some time ago: duplicating Linux 
page cache in the user space. But will you like it?

The zero-copy cached I/O has not yet been implemented in SCST, I simply 
so far have not had time for that. Currently SCST performs better STGT, 
because of simpler processing path and less context switches per 
command. Memcpy() speed on modern systems is about the same as 
throughput of 20Gbps link (1600MB/s), so when the zero-copy will be 
implemented, I won't be surprised by more 50-70% SCST advantage.
