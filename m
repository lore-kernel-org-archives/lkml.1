Yeah, I know. I'll test 'intel_iommu=strict' option next time.

The patch also has 'intel_iommu=strict' option. Wiht it enabled, it
flushes TLB cache every time dma_unmap_* is called as the original
code does.

Why did you choose the RB tree instead of a traditional bitmap scheme
to manage free space?

Thanks a lot!
