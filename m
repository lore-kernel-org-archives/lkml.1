James hi.

What about this BUG. It affects anybody doing bidi commands. The possibilities
are an sglist leak at best, and a crash at worse.

I understand this code needs cleanup, but first things first. Lets first fix the
bug, which should also go to stable. Then the cleanup can go to next merge window.

BTW: Should I attempt a cleanup on current code, or should I wait for Alan's Patch
to go in first?

Thanks
Boaz
