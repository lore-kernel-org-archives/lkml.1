I am not familiar with the low-level details of the PC.
Let me check Wikipedia...
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Mode
SMI = System Management Interrupt

<quote>
     * Since the SMM code (SMI handler) is installed by the system 
firmware (BIOS), the OS and the SMM code may have expectations about 
hardware settings that are incompatible, such as different ideas of how 
the APIC should be set up.

     * Operations in SMM take CPU time away from the OS, since the CPU 
state must be stored to memory (SMRAM) and any write back caches must be 
flushed. This can destroy real-time behavior and cause clock ticks to 
get lost.

     * A digital logic analyser may be required to determine if SMM is 
occurring.

     * Recovering the SMI handler code to analyze it for bugs, 
vulnerabilities, and secrets requires a logic analyzer or dissassembly 
of the system firmware.
</quote>

Do PCs typically enter System Management Mode periodically?

Is it possible to disable SMM?

According to the Wikipedia article, even the kernel is unaware that
the CPU has entered SMM, is that correct?

I've run my tests on a Dell PC. IIRC, the BIOS options are very basic.

I'll also try another PC as you suggest.

NB: I've attached dmesg and dot.config
If you see anything in there I should have turned on, or that I
should have turned off... (Should I disable power management?)

+++++

On a related note, John, AFAIU, you wrote the GTOD infrastructure. In my 
app, I need to call clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, ...) very often, i.e. 
around 2000 times every second (when I receive a packet, and when I 
re-send a packet). Is there a way to improve the overhead / latency of 
these calls? I've heard about vsyscalls, are they relevant?

Do I need a specific glibc to use vsyscalls?

If I call clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &spec) twice in a row, then 
subtract the two timespecs, I get ~1400 ns on a 2.8 GHz P4. AFAIU, my 
clock source is acpi_pm. I tried setting it to tsc but it made hell 
break loose.

http://groups.google.com/group/fa.linux.kernel/msg/a095241d49adfc44?dmode=source

Apparently, 1400 ns is similar to what you observe with acpi_pm.
I suppose I'll need to use the TSC if I want any improvement?

+++++

Over the past few days, I've sent over 10 messages to the LKML, and none 
of them have been archived. It seems majordomo is dropping my messages. 
Do they look like spam?

Regards.
