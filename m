Ok, but in case of data corruption, at least your filesystem does not
degrade further.

I can reproduce data loss with ext3 on flashcard in about 40
seconds. I'd not call that "odd event". It would be nice to handle
that, but that is hard. So ... can we at least get that documented
please?

Ok, that's obviously game over.

_Maybe_ SSDs, being HDD replacements are better. I don't know.

_All_ flash cards (MMC, USB, SD) had the problems. You don't need to
get clear grasp on trends. Those cards just don't meet ext3
expectations, and if you pull them, you get data loss.

"Nothing is perfect"?! That's design decision/problem in raid5/ext3. I
believe that should be at least documented. (And understand why ZFS is
interesting thing).

And I still use my zaurus with crappy DRAM.

I would not trust raid5 array with my data, for multiple
reasons. The fact that degraded raid5 breaks ext3 assumptions should
really be documented.

The papers show failures in "once a year" range. I have "twice a
minute" failure scenario with flashdisks.

Not sure how often "degraded raid5 breaks ext3 atomicity" would bite,
but I bet it would be on "once a day" scale.

We should document those.
