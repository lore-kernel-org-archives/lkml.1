Not sure I follow you.  You'd never remove any code.  But you'd only 
start tracing new callers of the function.  If the function loops 
indefinitely, you could potentially have some users which never end up 
getting traced.  Also, if those users depend on instructions in the 
first 5 bytes of the function, they would crash because of the jump to 
the new function patched on top of them.

Overall, it doesn't seem like a very satisfactory mechanism...
