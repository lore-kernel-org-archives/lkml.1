	Good morning.  During a maintainance, I've changed (20 hours ago) the reserved
block count in my servers' data partition to 0.  In some hours, I've got a number
of errors (5) in ext3 in different servers that are not possible by simple luck.
The errors are:

=========================================================
EXT3-fs error (device md3): ext3_new_block: Allocating block in system zone - blocks from 8192000, length 1
Aborting journal on device md3.
Remounting filesystem read-only
EXT3-fs error (device md3): ext3_free_blocks: Freeing blocks in system zones - Block = 8192000, count = 1

	I have some servers with a single SAS disc and others with a software RAID10
volume over 4 discs.  So far, only the RAID10 volumes are showing errors.
Coincidence?

	This is Debian etch, and 2.6.24.2.  The command line we've run was:

tune2fs -r 0 partition

while MySQL was running.  The e2fsprogs version is 1.39+1.40-WIP-2006.11.14+dfsg-2etch1.

	Do you know of any problem with this setup?  I've reviewed the e2fsprogs
changelog searching for something like this but it seems rather related to
RAID10+ext3 interaction.

	We have lots of servers waiting for crashing, I suspect.  While I was writing
this mail another one crashed.  Probably I can provide superblock copies for
analysis or any other information.

	Best regards,


		Ender.
