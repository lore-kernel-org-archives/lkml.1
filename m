Yeah, that was not one of the things that we liked either. We tried
other ways to get around the get_task_struct but, ended up with
the get_task_struct in the end anyway.

Caching the rq is an interesting idea. But since the rq struct is local to 
sched.c, what would be a good API to do this?

in mutex.c:

	void *rq;

	[...]

	rq = get_task_rq(owner);
	spin_unlock(&lock->wait_lock);

	[...]

	if (!task_running_on_rq(rq, owner))


in sched.c:


	void *get_task_rq(struct task_struct *p)
	{
		return task_rq(p);
	}

	int task_running_on_rq(void *r, struct task_sturct *p)
	{
		struct rq *rq = r;

		return rq->curr == p;
	}

??
