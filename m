Sorry, it isn't correct. ACA provides possibility to lock commands queue 
in case of CHECK CONDITION, so allows to keep commands execution order 
in case of errors. CmdSN keeps commands execution order only in case of 
success, in case of error the next queued command will be executed 
immediately after the failed one, although application might require to 
have all subsequent after the failed one commands aborted. Think about 
journaled file systems, for instance. Also ACA allows to retry the 
failed command and then resume the queue.
