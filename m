When the newer block has the wrong checksum you first need to correct
that. If you find a wrong checksum on read that is easy to do. But you
won't detect this on writes.

One solution I can think of is this:

- user writes to sector A
- compare checksum of sector A in M1 and M2
  if checksums differ:
  - read sector A and calculate checksum
  - if M1 has the right checksum update M2
  - wait
- write new checksum to M1
- wait
- write data to sector A
- wait
- write new checksum to M2
