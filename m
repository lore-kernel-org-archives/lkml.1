I totally agree.  You should see the ways that people have tried to
circumvent the current kobject/sysfs code over the past years.  It's so
scary it's not even funny...

I would be interested in seeing what your patches look like.  I don't
think that we should take any more sysfs changes for 2.6.24 as we do
have a lot of them right now, and I don't think that Tejun and I agree
on the future direction of the outstanding ones just yet.

But I don't think that your multiple-mount patches could make it into
.24, unless .23 is still weeks away.

That's reasonable.

That is going to be interesting to see how you come up with a way to do
hat.

Um, no, that's not going to happen.  /dev/sda will _always_ have the
same major:minor number, as defined by the LSB spec.  You can not break
that at all.  So while you might not want to show all mounts
/sys/devices/block/sda/ the ones that you do, will all have the LSB
defined major:minor number assigned to it.
