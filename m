I ran a test to show how readers can be starved in certain cases. I launched
one reader and three writers. I ran this test twice. First without dm-ioband
and then with dm-ioband.

Following are few lines from the script to launch readers and writers.

**************************************************************
sync
echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

# Launch writers on sdd2
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/sdd2/writezerofile1 bs=4K count=262144 &

# Launch  writers on sdd1
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/sdd1/writezerofile1 bs=4K count=262144 &
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/sdd1/writezerofile2 bs=4K count=262144 &

echo "sleeping for 5 seconds"
sleep 5

# launch reader on sdd1
time dd if=/mnt/sdd1/testzerofile1 of=/dev/zero &
echo "launched reader $!"
*********************************************************************

Without dm-ioband, reader finished in roughly 5 seconds.

With dm-ioband, reader took, more than 2 minutes to finish.

I had created ioband1 on /dev/sdd1 and ioband2 on /dev/sdd2 with weights
200 and 100 respectively.

Thanks
