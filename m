This is racy ... although I think the race would only show in a pre-empt
kernel:  complete causes the thread to run immediately pre-empting us.
Now it runs around the loop, through kthread_should_stop() and back to
wait_for_completion() before we get a chance to run kthread_stop().

The only way to avoid this seems to be to use wait queues and wake up
(kthread_stop does an automatic wake_up of the process, which is ignored
by completions).
