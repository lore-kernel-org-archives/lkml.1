Sorry, I meant "if the an inode marked as deleted is linked in a
directory" - describing what causes the condition. But yes, I'm
basically proposing to remap ESTALE to EIO here.

Sorry about that; it's my first patch submission so I'm not entirely
up to speed on such keywords...

Okay then - hopefully it won't happen again, but I'll keep that in
mind if there is a next time :)

I can leave it without the unlikely(), as it was before, but as far as
I can tell, this should never happen under a non-corrupted, non-broken
hardware filesystem, so it seems like a reasonable annotation to me.

Okay, I'll update the patch and resubmit.
