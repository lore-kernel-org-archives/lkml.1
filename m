FWIW I'm seeing similar things on fast storage (Fusion IO),
though this is under 2.6.31.  500MB/s+ for xfs, 300 for ext4.

Overwriting an existing file is no faster.   I don't think this
driver is blktraceable but I'll try a newer driver that should be I think.

(xfs's overwrite went from 534 to 597 mb/s; ext4 sat at 320-ish)

direct IO was good for both xfs & ext4 at around 530mb/s

I'll see if I can get this running on a more recent kernel to
do further investigation.
