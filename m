OK.

That's not code documentation :(

Your email client is converting tabs to non-ascii crap.  gmail.  Sigh.

OK.

But there's no way in which the reader of either the patch or the
resulting code can discover this subtlety.

Well seqlock is _a_ solution.  Another is to use a mutex or an rwsem
around the whole operation.

With the code as you propose it, what happens if a process sits in a
tight loop running setproctitle?  Do other processes running `ps' get
stuck in a livelock until the offending process gets scheduled out?
