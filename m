Yeah, I think I may have gone a bit overboard in applying this so
quickly. It's just not a good interface, silently adding the extra
length if asked to complete more. It may even happen right now, for a
driver that does no padding (it probably wont do any harm here either,
but still).

I'll try and see if I can come up with something cleaner.

My basic design paradigm for this is that the _driver_ (or mid layer, if
SCSI wants to handle it) should care about the padding. So make it easy
for them to pad, but have it 'unrolled' by completion time. We should
NOT need any extra_len checks or additions in the block/ directory,
period.
