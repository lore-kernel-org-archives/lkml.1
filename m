Do you mean that the patch applies after removing " @@.*$"?

To be safe, I created the patch with quilt as well as git, for 2.6.29.

They helped, thank you!

You are right. In your case, there are several big dirty files in sdb1,
and the sdb write queue is constantly (almost-)congested. The SSD write
speed is so slow, that in each round of sdb1 writeback, it begins with
an uncongested queue, but quickly fills up after writing some pages.
Hence all the inodes will get redirtied because of (nr_to_write > 0).

The following quick fix should solve the slow-writeback-on-congested-SSD
problem. However the writeback sequence is suboptimal: it sync-and-requeue
each file until congested (in your case about 3~600 pages) instead of
until MAX_WRITEBACK_PAGES=1024 pages.

A more complete fix would be turning MAX_WRITEBACK_PAGES into an exact
per-file limit. It has been sitting in my todo list for quite a while...

Thanks,
Fengguang
