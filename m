I wasn't actually planning that ... I was planning to say we have an NDA
programme to allow them to get their docs and early access silicon in to
the hands of potential developers who can help on the driver.

Heh, OK ... I'm happy to bet that the market won't be too appreciative
of a chip like this, unless its sold as pure SATA.  The only real reason
for HBAs to speak SAS as well as SATA is that most dual SAS/SATA
enclosures have internal expanders, which this chip won't be able to
talk to.

On the other hand, I think I can find a nice lever to move Marvell with,
so I'll take this on without needing potentially to compromise your
contacts.
