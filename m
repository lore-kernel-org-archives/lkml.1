That's what you get from a simplistic view.

If you look at the full history, scsi.h and sg.h were exported in 2006
by the initial commit by David Woodhouse

commit 8555255f0b426858d8648c6206b70eb906cf4ec7
Author: David Woodhouse <dwmw2@infradead.org>
Date:   Sun Jun 18 12:14:01 2006 +0100

    Add generic Kbuild files for 'make headers_install'

They were unexported again a year later, apparently on grounds of
clashing with /usr/include/scsi from glibc:

commit e629a7ddc0188e1bb9e956e698a9bd00c19c9854
Author: Olaf Hering <olh@suse.de>
Date:   Tue Oct 16 23:27:01 2007 -0700

    do not export /usr/include/scsi in make headers_install

So perhaps the meta question is how are we supposed to resolve this?
Glibc ceded it's copy of /usr/include/linux to the kernel headers
package, so it looks to be an oversight that it still
retains /usr/include/scsi (there's nothing extra in there in glibc
beyond what SCSI exports).
