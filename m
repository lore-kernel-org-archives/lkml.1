There is a bit in the extent structure which indicates that the extent
has not been initialized.  When reading from a block where the extent
is marked as unitialized, ext4 returns zero's, to avoid returning the
uninitalized contents of the disk, which might contain someone else's
love letters, p0rn, or other information which we shouldn't leak out.
When writing to an extent which is uninitalized, we may potentially
have to split the extent into three extents in the worst case.

My understanding is that XFS uses a similar implementation; it's a
pretty obvious and standard way to implement allocated-but-not-initialized
extents.

We thought about supporting persistent preallocation for inodes using
indirect blocks, but it would require stealing a bit from each entry
in the indirect block, reducing the maximum size of the filesystem by
two (i.e., 2**31 blocks).  It was decided it wasn't worth the
complexity, given the tradeoffs.
