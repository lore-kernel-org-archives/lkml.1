Promised patch...

The qla1280 driver was ANDing the output value of mailbox register
0 with (1 << target-number) to determine whether to enable queueing
on the target in question.

But mailbox register 0 has the status code for the mailbox command
(in this case, Set Target Parameters).  Potential values are:
/*      
 * ISP mailbox command complete status codes
 */
#define MBS_CMD_CMP             0x4000  /* Command Complete. */
#define MBS_INV_CMD             0x4001  /* Invalid Command. */
#define MBS_HOST_INF_ERR        0x4002  /* Host Interface Error. */
#define MBS_TEST_FAILED         0x4003  /* Test Failed. */
#define MBS_CMD_ERR             0x4005  /* Command Error. */
#define MBS_CMD_PARAM_ERR       0x4006  /* Command Parameter Error. */

So clearly that is in error.  I can't think what the author of that
line was looking for in a mailbox register, so I just eliminated the
AND.  flag is used later in the function, and I think that the later
usage was also wrong, though it was used to set values that aren't
used.  Oh well, an overhaul of this driver is not what I want to do
now -- just a bugfix. 

After the fix, I found that my disks were getting a queue depth of
255, which is far too many.  Most SCSI disks are limited to 32 or
64.  In any case, there's no point, queueing up a bunch of commands
to the adapter that will just result in queue full or starve other
targets from being issued commands due to running out of internal
memory.  So I dropped default queue depth to 32 (from which 1 is
subtracted elsewhere, giving net of 31).

I tested with a Seagate ST336753LC, and results look good, so
I'm satisfied with this patch.
