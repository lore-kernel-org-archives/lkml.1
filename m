I think I know ... unsigned char gets promoted to signed int since it will
fit.  then signed int gets cast to unsigned long long, sign-extending.  C's
promotion rules have always felt a bit wacky to me.

this certainly fixes your problem.  I'd prefer this patch instead, just
because I find the cast unaesthetic ...

Fix READ CAPACITY 10 with drives over 1TB

Shifting an unsigned char implicitly casts it to a signed int.  This
caused 'lba' to sign-extend and Linux would then try READ CAPACITY 16
which was not supported by at least one drive.  Making 'lba' an unsigned
int ensures that sign extension will not occur.
