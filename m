Hmm, I don't understand. What's wrong in this small helper function? Are 
you against any helper functions, so, all users of, e.g., for_each_sg() 
must instead open code the corresponding functionality?

Do you want me to move scsi_execute_async() from scsi_lib.c to 
scst_lib.c and rename it to scst_execute_async()? This is the maximum I 
can do, because I need this functionality. But it will make all other 
possible users to duplicate it.

Does flag SCSI_ASYNC_EXEC_FLAG_AT_HEAD have nothing to do to SCSI, really?

What job should a driver do? As I wrote, for SCST allocation of the 
sense buffer is necessary in any case (in SCST sense is allocated on 
demand only), so it doesn't matter to allocate few bytes more, if it 
allows to hide unneeded low level details. The same, I guess, should be 
true for all other possible users of this functionality.

I can't see how *well documented* stacking of end_io_data can be/lead to 
any problem. All the possible alternatives I can see are worse:

1. Add in struct request one more field, like "void *blk_end_io_data" 
and use it.

2. Duplicate code of bio's allocation and chaining 
(__blk_rq_map_kern_sg()) for the copy case with additional code for 
allocation and copying of the copy buffers on per-bio basis and use 
bio->bi_private to track the copy info. Tejun Heo used this approach, 
but he had only one bio without any chaining. With the chaining this 
approach becomes terribly overcomplicated and ugly with *NO* real gain.

Do you like any of them? If not, I'd like to see _practical_ suggestions.

Thanks.
Vlad
