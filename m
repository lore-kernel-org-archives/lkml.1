/me goes back to the bug from last year about stable inode/gen numbers
for a HSM.

Which was soundly rejected by the HSM folk because it wraps at 4 billion
inode create/unlink cycles in an AG rather than per inode. The only thing
they were happy with was the old behaviour and so they now mount their
filesystems with ikeep. At that point the issue was dropped on the floor;
the NFS side of things apparently weren't causing any problems so we didn't
consider it urgent to fix....

Given this state of affairs (i.e. HSM using ikeep), I guess we can do
anything we want for the noikeep case. I'll cook up a patch that does
something similar to ext3 generation numbers for the initial seeding....

That was for in memory counters not on disk, and the problem really was
free block counts rather than free inode counts. Yes, I converted the
inode counters at the same time, but that wasn't the limiting factor.
Updates to the on disk superblock, OTOH, are a limiting factor and
that was the lazy superblock counter modifications solve....

Cheers,

Dave.
