Who might have rebuilt the whole kernel using a new signature.

Or a bug reporter might have edited out the parts containing the 
information that unsupported code was loaded.

Or the unsupported module itself might have removed all traces of having 
been loaded from the kernel.

For printing nvidia(U), you could simply add some marker similar to 
MODULE_LICENSE() that gets added to supported modules during "official" 
builds and gets checked when loading a module.

That's 10k LOC less and the same level of security...
