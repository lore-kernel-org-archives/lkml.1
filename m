One of us must be having a brain cramp because it looks to me like the
buffer doesn't need protection -- it's on the stack. It's probably me
but I'm just not seeing how this use is unsafe..

> Why does it need to be static anyway?  64 bytes on-stack is OK.

Uh, it is on stack. It doesn't use the C keyword "static". It's just
poorly-named.
