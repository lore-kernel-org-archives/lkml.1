I'm getting confused about your idea.

I thought you wanted to make each cgroup have its own rb-tree,
and wanted to make all the layers share the same rb-tree.
If so, are you going to put different things into the same tree?
Do you even want all the I/O schedlers use the same tree?

Are you going to block request descriptors in the tree?
>From the view point of performance, all the request descriptors
should be passed to the I/O schedulers, since the maximum number
of request descriptors is limited. 

And I still don't understand if you want to make your rb-tree
work efficiently, you need to put a lot of bios or request descriptors
into the tree. Is that what you are going to do?
On the other hand, dm-ioband tries to minimize to have bios blocked.
And I have a plan on reducing the maximum number that can be
blocked there.

Sorry to bother you that I just don't understand the concept clearly.

I don't care whether the queue is implemented as a rb-tee or some
kind of list because they are logically the same thing.

They never look into the queues maintained in drivers.
Some of them have its own little queue and others don't.
Some may just modify the sector numbers of I/O requests or may
create a new I/O request themselves. Others such as md-raid5
have their own queues to control I/Os, where A write request may
cause several read requests and have to wait for their completions
before the actual write starts.
