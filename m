Subject: [PATCH 1 of 1] cciss: add procfs interface to rescan logical volumes

Patch 1 of 1

This patch adds a procfs interface so users can force a rescan of the
logical volumes attached to the controller. A new product uses Target Based
Management (TBM) out-of-band for configuration purposes. With this method
the driver has no way of knowing that something has changed, i.e., new
logical volume(s) added or existing volumes deleted.
This interface allows the user to echo "rescan volumes" >
/proc/driver/cciss/ccissN to force the driver to rebuild our table of
logical volumes. 
Please consider this patch for inclusion.

Thanks,
mikem

+Rescanning for changes in configuration
+---------------------------------------
+
+Some new products use Target Based Management (TBM) for configuration
+purposes. These products cannot inform the driver that a new logical volume
+has been added, an existing volume deleted, or of change in the size of a
+logical volume. 
+A procfs interface has been added to facilitate a rescan of the devices
+attached to the controller. If a change is made the user may then issue:
+
+	# echo "rescan volumes" > /proc/driver/cciss/ccissN
+
+where N is the controller number. This will force the driver to update the
+configuration.
