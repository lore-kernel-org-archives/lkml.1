I think the number of different greps which was needed to find all the
above was excessive.  Too many levels of wrappers and helpers.

If there was documentation at the intermediate levels then that would
terminate the search early.  But working out the _actual_ semantics of
(say) BIO_RW_SYNCIO is quite hard!

Perhaps that mean that Ted didn't know what his own patch did.  I
certainly couldn't work it out.  That's a problem, IMO!

OK.

But what is the advantage in doing this stream of unplugs?  For your
average fsync(), we're probably doing tens of thousands per second.
Does it actually help?

I assume that the actual code path for such a buffer becomes a lot
longer because we need to go beyond the the queueing layer and perhaps
as far down as the device driver for each block, so the CPU cost will
go up?

Could we get this in patch form, pretty please?

The description isn't terribly useful unless the reader is told what
actions the schedulers are expected to take in response to the hint.

Ditto, somewhat.

OK.
