Well, I'm not saying it loses data on _every_ powerfail ;-).

Ok, fixed.

I actually think it was. write() syscall does not guarantee anything,
fsync() does.

I actually believe Ted's writeup is good.

I'd expect SATA SSDs to have that solved, yes. Again, Ted does not say
it affects _all_ such devices, and it certianly did affect all that I seen.

Ok, latest version is below, can you suggest improvements? (And yes,
details when exactly RAID-5 misbehaves should be noted somewhere. I
don't know enough about RAID arrays, can someone help?)

There are storage devices that high highly undesirable properties
when they are disconnected or suffer power failures while writes are
in progress; such devices include flash devices and MD RAID 4/5/6
arrays.  These devices have the property of potentially
corrupting blocks being written at the time of the power failure, and
worse yet, amplifying the region where blocks are corrupted such that
additional sectors are also damaged during the power failure.
        
Users who use such storage devices are well advised take
countermeasures, such as the use of Uninterruptible Power Supplies,
and making sure the flash device is not hot-unplugged while the device
is being used.  Regular backups when using these devices is also a
Very Good Idea.
        
Otherwise, file systems placed on these devices can suffer silent data
and file system corruption.  An forced use of fsck may detect metadata
corruption resulting in file system corruption, but will not suffice
to detect data corruption.
