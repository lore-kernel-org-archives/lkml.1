Hi Alasdair,

This patch-set is the updated version of request-based dm-multipath.
The changes from the previous version (*) are to follow up the change
of the interface to export lld's busy state (PATCH 5).

(*) http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/9/12/100

All necessary interfaces to support request stacking drivers are now
in the for-2.6.28 branch of the Jens' linux-2.6-block git repository.
This patch-set depends on those interfaces.

This patch-set is created on top of 2.6.27-rc8 + your patches shown
between "NEXT_PATCHES_START" and "NEXT_PATCHES_END" of the series file:
  ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/dm/patches/2.6-unstable/editing-quilt/patches/series.html

Please review and apply.


Summary of the patches:
  1/8: dm core: remove unused DM_WQ_FLUSH_ALL
  2/8: dm core: tidy local_init
  3/8: dm core: add kmem_cache for request-based dm
  4/8: dm core: add target interfaces for request-based dm
  5/8: dm core: add core functions for request-based dm
  6/8: dm core: enable request-based dm
  7/8: dm core: reject I/O violating new queue limits
  8/8: dm-mpath: convert to request-based
  (PATCH 1 is also included in the Milan's barrier support patch-set)
