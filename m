  OK, so we couldn't stat a directory...

  This is probably the misleading output from ext3_iget(). It should give
you EIO in the latest kernel.

  The directory itself looks fine...

  Ah, OK, here's the problem. The directory points to a file which is
obviously deleted (note the "Links: 0"). All the content of the inode seems
to indicate that the file was correctly deleted (you might check that the
corresponding bit in the bitmap is cleared via: "icheck 88541562").
  The question is how it could happen the directory still points to the
inode. Really strange. It looks as if we've lost a write to the directory
but I don't see how. Are there any suspitious kernel messages in this case?

  It probably won't help. This particular directory had just one block so
DIR_INDEX had no effect on it.

  OK, so it's probably not a storage device problem. Good to know.
