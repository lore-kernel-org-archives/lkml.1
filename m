Not necessarily for the problem at hand, but in the long run, is it
worth isolating kernel's siginfo from user's siginfo_t (which is pretty
much carved in stone).

Like the existing 'struct k_sigaction' and 'struct sigaction' have
a 'struct k_siginfo' that is a superset of 'siginfo_t' ?

That might give us more flexibility in passing any additional flags/
values we need in the kernel ?
