Just to add some real world data, Bianca Schroeder published a really good paper 
that looks at failures in national labs which has actual measured disk failures:

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bianca/fast07.pdf

Her numbers showed various rates of failures, but depending on the box, drive 
type, etc, they lost between 1-6% of the install drives each year.

There is also a good paper from Google:

http://labs.google.com/papers/disk_failures.html

Both of the above are largely linux boxes.

And several other FAST papers on failures in commercial RAID boxes, most notably 
by NetApp.

If reading papers is not at the top of your list of things to do, just skim 
through and look for the tables on disk failures, etc. which have great 
measurements of what really failed in these systems...
