Absolutely.

You use nfs to share filesystems among separate machines that you want
to have look similar.

You use user namespaces to pretend one machine is a bunch of separate
machines.  So if you're just going to split up your machine into 5
vms and then have them all share disk over nfs, you may just want to
keep it as one machine :)

Ideally each vm would have completely separate disk space, so file
access across user namespaces wouldn't happen.  More realistically,
file trees will be shared read-only - i.e. /lib, /usr, etc.  Some of
that can be handled simply using read-only bind mounts.  We'd like
to allow users to create vm's as well, so then we want uid 500 in
the initial user namespace to be uid 0 in a newly created user
namespace.

So what Eric and I are worried about are corner cases and admin
mistakes, not regular function.

(And again I really do think we'll want to tie netlink sockets to a user
namespace, not a network namespace, so there may be no issue at all
so long as proper filesystem access checks are implemented so that every
action on some filesystem is done with credentials valid in that
filesystems' user namespace)
