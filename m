  Is this really different? If we spot error during checkpointing, we
abort journal (so data still remain in the journal because checkpointing
has failed). On next mount, either replay succeeds and everything is fine,
or we spot error during replay and we should just refuse to mount the
filesystem. So we are correct again - user then has to run fsck to solve
the problem and that will try it's best to get most data readable. So I
don't see why checkpointing bug would need a special attention.

  OK, the last option is also fine with me. Thanks for your work.
