I believe this is the reference that Stuart refers to in the ATA-6 spec:

http://www.t10.org/t13/project/d1410r3a-ATA-ATAPI-6.pdf

Here's the snippet, (p327):

"
Transition D0HR1:D0HR1: When the sample indicates that DASP- is negated
and            less than 450 ms have
elapsed since the negation of RESET-, then the device shall make a
transition to the   D0HR1: Sample_DASP-
state. When the sample indicates that DASP- is negated and greater than
450 ms          but less than 5 s have
elapsed since the negation of RESET-, then the device may make a
transition to the     D0HR1: Sample_DASP-
state.
Transition D0HR1:D0HR3: When the sample indicates that DASP- is negated
and 5 s have elapsed since the
negation of RESET-, then the device shall clear bit 7 in the Error
register and make a transition to the D0HR3:
Set_status state. When the sample indicates that DASP- is negated and
greater than 450 ms but less than 5 s
have elapsed since the negation of RESET-, then the device may clear bit
7 in the Error register and make a
transition to the D0HR3: Set_status state.
