Well what are these lockdep warnings?  Normally such a warning means that
we have a locking bug. I _assume_ that you've determined that the warnings
are false-positives?

The warning which Mariusz Kozlowski discovered ("Subject: Re:
2.6.26-rc2-mm1: possible circular locking dependency detected") was
triggered by the "class semaphore to mutex" conversion and it looks
like a real bug to me.  Would your patch prevent warnings such as that
one from being available to us?
