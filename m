I see that several of these processes are in a D state, yet they recover in a very short time back to running (a few seconds) and then the CPU goes from 0% to 100% usage (which is correct, these CPU's should be running @ 100% as they're running some number crunching simulations, but when in D state CPU usage goes to 0%).

All my previous installations have run fine w/ this same NFS config.

I've tested the myrinet and ether interconnects and I see no issues from node to node or switch. I can reproduce the problem every time between any one node and the master.

I guess it would help if you can run

	echo w > /proc/sysrq-trigger

and manage to hit enter when this is happening.

Then run

	dmesg -c -s 1000000 > foo

then check `foo' to see that you caught some nice traces of the stuck tasks.

Then send us those traces.  Please try to avoid wordwrapping them in
the email.
