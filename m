People still complain about hey-my-files-are-all-full-of-zeroes on XFS.

We can make great improvements here, and I've (twice) previously decribed
how: hoist the entire ordered-mode data handling out of ext3, and out of
the buffer_head layer and move it up into the VFS pagecache layer. 
Basically, do ordered-data with a commit-time inode walk, calling
do_sync_mapping_range().

Do it in the VFS.  Make reiserfs use it, remove reiserfs ordered-mode too. 
Make XFS use it, fix the hey-my-files-are-all-full-of-zeroes problem there.

And guess what?  We can then partly fix _this_ problem too.  If we're
running a commit on behalf of fsync(inode1) and we come across an inode2
which doesn't have any block allocation metadata in this commit, we don't
need to sync inode2's pages.

Weep.  It's times like this when I want to escape all this patch-wrangling
nonsense and go do some real stuff.
