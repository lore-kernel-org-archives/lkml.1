Hmm. what do you mean by not usable ? I see your email here:

Yes, afaics, we just need to pass one extra bit of information per signal
(whether or not sender is in ancestor-ns) from sender to receiver.

Yes, if user-space sets si_pid to 0.

Can we change sys_rt_sigqueueinfo() to:

	if (!info->si_pid)
		info->si_pid = getpid();

or would that change semantics adversely ? How about putting this
under CONFIG_PID_NS or your CONFIG_I_DO_CARE_ABOUT_NAMESPACES ;)

I agree

You mean the in_interrupt() check we had in earlier patchset would
not be enough ?

CONFIG_PID_NS ?
