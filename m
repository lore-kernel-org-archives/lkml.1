It might help to agree on terminology.  For example, in the USB
mass-storage protocol, "Error" means the command or its result could
not be transferred at all -- a problem at the link layer.  "Failure"
means the command was received and possibly executed to some extent,
but the device returned Check Condition status.  "Success" means the 
same as failure except that the device returned Okay status rather than 
Check Condition.

So for an error, the residue is meaningless (although you could say
that it was equal to the full transfer length if you want).  For a
failure or a success it is meaningful, and it need not be the same as
the amount of data transferred.

Incidentally, as long as we're trying to be precise about terminology,
the correct term is "residue", not "residual".  In fact, the last time
I checked a copy of the SCSI spec the word "residual" did not occur
anywhere in it.

These should all be described either as failures or as successes with
a partial transfer, not as errors.
