Looks plausible, although as David comments I don't think it handles a concurrent CPU hotplug/unplug. Also I don't like the idea of doing a cgroup_lock() across sched_setaffinity() - cgroup_lock() can be held for relatively long periods of time.

Here's an alternative for consideration, below. The main differences are:

- currently against an older kernel with pre-cgroup cpusets, so it uses tasklist_lock and do_each_thread(); a cgroup version would use cgroup iterators as yours does

- solves the race between sched_setaffinity() and update_cpumask() by having sched_setaffinity() check for changes to cpuset_cpus_allowed() after doing set_cpus_allowed()

- guarantees to only act on each process once (so guarantees forward progress, in the absence of fork bombs. (And could be adapted to handle fork bombs too)

- uses a priority heap to pick the processes to act on, based on start time

- uses lock_cpu_hotplug() to avoid races with CPU hotplug; sadly I think this is gone in more recent kernels, so some other synchronization would be needed
