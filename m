Doesn't make any difference.

git-bisect taught me it was introduced by

commit 38582a62ecd337de4212004c7d4844899dc57890
Author: James Bottomley <James.Bottomley@HansenPartnership.com>
Date:   Wed Feb 6 13:01:58 2008 -0600

    [SCSI] sr: fix test unit ready responses
    
    Commit 210ba1d1724f5c4ed87a2ab1a21ca861a915f734 updated sr.c to use
    the scsi_test_unit_ready() function.  Unfortunately, this has the
    wrong characteristic of eating NOT_READY returns which sr.c relies on
    for tray status.
    
    Fix by rolling an internal sr_test_unit_ready() that doesn't do this.
