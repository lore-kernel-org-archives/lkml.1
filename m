Presumably you have a laptop hard disk.  That's currently SCSI if you
use ATA ... although when ATA moves out of SCSI it will no longer be, so
you could regard this as a temporary condition.

But that's the point: async scan is always "enabled" it just might not
be the default, that's what the CONFIG_SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC controls: the
default value (but you can always turn it on with the kernel boot or
SCSI module option).  Async scan is also functional for /drivers/ata and
other hot plug type busses, so it still makes sense for them as well.

Well, we do use CONFIG_MODULES to try to discern whether the user wants
modules or not.  However, if you enable modules, we'd need some
telepathic configurator to tell us if you plan to use SCSI HBA modules
or not, so the safest course is always to enable it.  The real point is
that you have to be a real power user to answer N correctly to this, so
it's better not to confuse the remaining 97% with the option because
they could easily get wrong ... the 3% who're sure they don't want it
can simply delete it.
