The jbd2 journal checksum support, along with the 64-bit journal block
layout is designed to be 100% compatible with jbd, so it would be
trivial to "back port" jbd2.  Just copy jbd2 into jbd, and add the
option to set (or set by default) the JBD_FEATURE_COMPAT_CHECKSUM
feature in the journal.

I was going to suggest complete removal of jbd2 at that point, but
the ordered-mode rewrite is still pending and should live in ext4
for a reasonably long while before going back to ext3.

Cheers, Andreas
