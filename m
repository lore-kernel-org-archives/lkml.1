I'm not sure about this. The ciss spec says that the controllers
support mandatory SCSI commands. About INQUIRY data, at least, debian
udev rules nicely created symbolic links under /dev/disk/by-id/.

Agreed, this is an area that we can improve greatly with the scsi
infrastructure, I think.

Agreed about keeping the existing interfaces (changing only the
internal implementation, which users don't care about). I thought
about the similar things (tricks like ide-scsi does) during writing a
patch but also thought that udev rules can do the similar jobs, as
James pointed out. And seems that udev rules nicely works.
