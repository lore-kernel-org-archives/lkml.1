As I have now acknowledged twice (and this makes three times), there
does not seem to be a practical way to avoid it in this instance. That
does not make it any less incorrect to send a duplicate private copy to
the person in question.

Of course not.

AFAIRK (though I could be mistaken), procmail is not available under
Windows, which is what I have to use for work purposes. I have an
interest in learning it form my own purposes, but it is very much on the
back burner.

I'm not disputing that. I just consider it incorrect anyway.

I'm not as fond of IMAP as I used to be, though I no longer remember
exactly why, but I thank you for the recommendation. When I have
opportunity I will check it out, though that will probably not be this
week. (I also thank Joseph for the confirmation that the problem does
lie with Gmail.)



And, since there is no longer anything specifically kernel-related in
this subthread, I do not intend to reply publicly in it again unless
requested to do so.
