xtime going backwards is actually allowable, as xtime does not store the
entire state of time.

Time is represented by the equation:
	xtime + (offset * mult) >> shift

Since we steer the clock by changing the mult value, imagine if we were
slowing down time, we'd decrese mult by one. However, since  offset may
be non-zero, we have to keep the equation balanced, or time might
actually go backwards.

Given:
	mult2 == mult1 - 1

	xtime1 + (offset * mult1) >> shift == xtime2 + (offset * mult2) >> shift
	xtime1 + (offset * mult1) >> shift == xtime2 + (offset * (mult1 - 1)) >> shift
	xtime1 + (offset * mult1) >> shift - (offset * (mult1 - 1)) >> shift == xtime2
	xtime1 + (offset * mult1 - offset * (mult1 - 1)) >> shift == xtime2
	xtime1 + (offset * mult1 - (offset * mult1 - offset*1)) >> shift == xtime2
	xtime1 + offset>> shift == xtime2

Now, if we are increasing mult, xtime will be decreased in the same
fashion. So the xtime value going backwards isn't wrong by itself, as
the corresponding offset * newmult will compensate.

xtime_cache actually stores a snapshot of the full state each call to
update_wall_time(), so you might want to use that in your printing
instead.


>From what I've seen so far debugging today it seems something goes off
in clocksource_bigadjust(), and the error continues to grow instead of
being corrected, and we end up constantly increasing mult.

I'm still not quite sure how this links to the hang, but I'm still digging.
