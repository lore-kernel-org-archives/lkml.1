The main motivation for your new syscall is to make it possible to
inject a process into a namespace. IOW, what you are proposing is
a new incarnation of sys_hijack().

This is _orthogonal_ to the current discussion, which is about an
extension for clone to allow (a) choosing target pid(s), (b) more
flags, and (c) future extensions.

(Your suggested syscall may, too, allow the request a specific set
of pids for the child process, and reuse the current code for that).

I suggest that you start a new thread about your RFC. This will
reduce distractions on the current thread, and bring more focus to
your proposal. I surely will post some comments there :)

Ew .. why would you do that ?

Others (me included) *will* try and may get upset if forbidden...
Seriously, there is no technical reason to restrict this.

Then start a daemon _in addition_ to the application, or write a
daemon that will launch the application and monitor it... And also
there is ptrace -

But, please let's take this off to a new thread about adding how to
add a process into a namespace from the outside. FYI, I do think
such an interface may be useful and nicer than the two alternatives
I suggested above.

Actually, I misread previously; I mean not forcing another process
to clone, but instead forcing another process to become a parent (and
I shall ignore the ethical issues :)

I still suspect it won't be welcome. Several people would have liked
to see CLONE_PARENT go away, too, if that was possible without breaking
userspace applications. Yet another reason to take it to a discussion
of its own.
