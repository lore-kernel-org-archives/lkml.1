Me being the king of delays, no need for apologies.  :-)

It's still dynamic from sysfs's POV and I think that will make
maintenance more difficult.

100 netns would mean 100 bits and 100 different views of them would mean
100 sb's where each sb would need bitmap larger than 100 bits.  I don't
think there would be a scalability problem.  Am I missing something?

No matter which criteria is used to select ns, it should end up being
mapped to a set of tags (here, ida allocated numbers).  Unless tags can
change dynamically, there shouldn't be functional difference.

I failed to follow here.  Can you please elaborate a bit?  If you can
describe a simple example to me, it would be much appreciated.

sysfs_tag_enabled() was meant to test whether a directory which is
tagged should be shown under the current sb.

What you described is pretty much what I'm talking about.  The only
difference is whether to use caller-provided pointer as tag or an
ida-allocated integer.  The last sentence of the above paragraph is
basically sys_tag_enabled() function (maybe misnamed).

The main reason why I'm whining about this so much is because I think
tag should be something abstracted inside sysfs proper.  It's something
which affects very internal operation of sysfs and I really want to keep
the implementation details inside sysfs.  Spreading implementation over
kobject and sysfs didn't turn out too pretty after all.

Thank you.
