So in an out of memory situation the buffers you don't have are a lot
faster than the pages I don't have?

I meant from user space ... the writes are done inside the kernel.

However, as Linus has pointed out, this discussion is getting a bit off
topic.  There's no actual evidence that copy problems are causing any
performatince issues issues for STGT.  In fact, there's evidence that
they're not for everything except IB networks.
