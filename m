Looks like that was me, apologies.  Breaking a documented interface to
userspace just set off an alarm.  But if we really convince ourselves
that it's useless, then OK.

(Though maybe your idea of leaving the line in place with just constant
zeros is good.  Just because the data's useless doesn't mean someone out
there may have a script that does otherwise useful things but that
happens to fail if it can't parse /proc/net/rpc/nfsd.)

Looks like it's been two years now--any chance of rebasing those patches
and resending?
