Sure, we could do that.  The slight problem is that we don't have
general agreement in the kernel how to handle sector_t.  So, the only
consumer in scsi, sd, does the sizeof(block) ? thing.  If you look in
libata you'll see that it unconditionally uses a u64 for picking up the
value of sector_t so the shift is never invalid ... if we're going to
start making macros for handling this, we probably need to ask the
janitors to fix all of our existing code to use them ... or we could
just let sleeping dogs lie ..

Is there even a valid use for CONFIG_LBD=n anymore, anyway?
