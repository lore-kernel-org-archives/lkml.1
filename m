The problem I have is that the way you word it steers people away from RAID5 and 
better data integrity. Your intentions are good, but your text is going to do 
considerable harm.

Most people don't intentionally drop power (or have a power failure) during RAID 
rebuilds....

Fsync heavy workloads with working barriers will tend to keep the write cache 
pretty empty (two barrier flushes per fsync) so this is not too surprising.

Drive behaviour depends on a lot of things though - how the firmware prioritizes 
writes over reads, etc.
