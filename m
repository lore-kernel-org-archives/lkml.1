__scsi_device_lookup and __scsi_device_lookup_by_target do not 
check for the sdev_state and hence return scsi_devices with 
sdev_state set to SDEV_DEL also. It has the following side effects.

We can have two scsi_devices with the same HBTL queued in 
the scsi_host->__devices/scsi_target->devices list, one
in the SDEV_DEL state and the other in, say SDEV_RUNNING state. 
    If the one in the SDEV_DEL state is before the one in SDEV_RUNNING 
state, (which will almost always be the case) the scsi_device_lookup and 
scsi_device_lookup_by_target will never find the totally legitimate
scsi_device (the one in the SDEV_RUNNING state).

This is because __scsi_device_lookup/__scsi_device_lookup_by_target 
always returns the first one in the list (which in our case is the 
one with the SDEV_DEL state) and the scsi_device_get() which is called by 
scsi_device_lookup/scsi_device_lookup_by_target will return -ENXIO 
for this scsi_device, resulting in scsi_device_lookup and 
scsi_device_lookup_by_target to return NULL.

        So we _cannot_ lookup a perfectly valid device present in the
list of scsi_devices. 

        The right thing to do is to not have __scsi_device_lookup
and __scsi_device_lookup_by_target match a device if the scsi_device
state is SDEV_DEL. This will also make these functions similar in 
behaviour to their scsi_device_lookup/scsi_device_lookup_by_target
counterparts, as the comments in the code suggest.

        One way by which we can have two scsi_devices in the list is 
as follows.        
        Suppose a scsi_device has some outstanding command(s) when 
scsi_remove_device is called for it. Due to the extra ref being held
by the command in flight, the __scsi_remove_device->put_device call 
will not actually free the scsi_device and it will remain in the 
scsi_device list albeit in the SDEV_DEL state. Now if we do a 
scsi_add_device for the same HBTL, a new device with the same HBTL
(this one in SDEV_RUNNING state) gets added to the scsi_device list. 
        
        Infact if we call scsi_add_device one more time, it happily 
goes ahead and tries to add it once more, as 
scsi_probe_and_add_lun->scsi_device_lookup_by_target does not return
the already existing device. This will though result in the kobject 
EEXIST warning dump.

        The patch below solves the problem described here by not
returning scsi_devices in SDEV_DEL state, thus allowing scsi_device
in SDEV_RUNNING state (if any) to be correctly returned, instead.


Thanx,
Tomar
