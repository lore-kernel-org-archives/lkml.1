Apparently mount(8) or mount.nfs(8) are doing the parsing and send down the legacy data block. So, what is the minimum version of mount or mount.nfs that pass the options down unaltered?

And perhaps add some dynamic tuning capabilities to the NFS client
code to just make it do "the right thing".  This would be better
than any tunables and would help to serve in other situations, such
as high bandwidth/latency networks, overloaded servers who don't
need more read-ahead READ requests piled on, etc...
