I guess that was a development rationale. Most of the namespaces are in 
use in the container projects like openvz, vserver and probably others 
and we needed a way to activate the code.

Not perfect I agree.

well, we're reaching the end. I hope ! devpts is in progress and
mq is just waiting for a clone flag.

well, the clone interface is a not friendly interface anyway. glibc wraps 
it and most users just use fork().

We will need a user library, like we have a libphtread or a libaio, to
effectively use the namespaces features. This is being worked on but
it's another topic.

Yes. this make sense. Most of the namespaces have dependencies between
each other.

yes. definitely agree.

but we still need a way to extend the clone flags because none are left.
would you say that the clone64 is the right way to go or should we rather 
go in the direction hpa proposed :

http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/4/9/318 :

if we could agree on some new interface, we could then make sure we
are not abusing it.

Thanks,

C.
