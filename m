The reason I mentioned making the number of SGs configurable is because with
a lot of controllers in the box (say 8, or ridiculous numbers of controllers
are potentially possible on some big ia64 boxes) then the memory available
by way of pci_alloc_consistent can be exhausted, and we have seen that happen.

The command buffers have to be in the first 4GB of memory, as the command
register is only 32 bits, so they are allocated by pci_alloc_consistent.
However, the chained SG lists don't have that limitation, so I think they
can be kmalloc'ed, and so not chew up and unreasonable amount of the
pci_alloc_consistent memory and get a larger number of SGs.   ...right?
Maybe that's the better way to do it.
