My book has a fairly detailed discussion of how these operations were
supposed to work and what the reasoning behind them was.
Unfortunately, I don't have time to really participate this discussion
at the moment, but I hope somebody else has access to the book and
would (re-)read it for some background (not to claim that it got
everything right 100% but to ensure that earlier mistakes are not
repeated...).
