What I'm upset about is that this has apparently gotten not even some 
trivial testing of the _default_ build. I'm not talking about any odd 
config options here. I'm literally talking about the only _sane_ config 
option case.

You yourself admit that even you don't have any actual devices that can 
support the block integrity stuff, yet you have apparently only compile- 
tested the insane case of still enabling that thing and apparently nobody 
else has bothered either.

Was this in linux-next?

Is linux-next coverage REALLY so weak that it doesn't even test the 
default config options, much less any random options? What's the point of 
linux-next then?

Again, the date on that thing is claimed to be September 19th, although it 
was obviously committed later.

I could trivially have fixed the compile issue. That's not what upsets me. 
What upsets me is that this set of patches apparently had almost nobody 
looking at them at all before they got sent to me.

If it was some odd and unusual config option, I'd be less upset. hey, 
stuff happens. But it sure as heck was nothing of the sort!
