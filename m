  Yes, it would. But how do you think it can happen that a metadata buffer
will be written back to the filesystem when it is a part of running
transaction? Note that checkpointing code specifically checks whether the
buffer being written back is part of a running transaction and if so, it
waits for commit before writing back the buffer. So I don't think this can
happen but maybe I miss something...
