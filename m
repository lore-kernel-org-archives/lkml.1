The point for building a big bio and splitting it is code size reduction.

You must realize that you need to split the request anyway. If the caller 
needs to read/write M sectors and the device can process at most N 
sectors, where N<M, then the i/o must be split. You can't get rid of that 
split.

Now, the question is, where this splitting happens. Currently, the 
splitting happens in the issuers of the bio (for example dm-io, which is a 
big chunk of code written just to work around the uncertain bio size 
limits) as well as in the consumers of the bio (md, dm and request-based 
drivers, if their maximum transfer size < PAGE_SIZE).

What I'm proposing is to put that bio splitting just in one place and 
remove it from both the issuers and the consumers of the bio.

There is just one case, where it is not desirable to create larger 
requests than the physical transfer size because of performance --- that 
is page cache readahead. That could use the current approach of querying 
the queue for limits and not stuffing more data than the device can 
handle.

In all the other (non-readahead) cases, the caller is waiting for all the 
data anyway, there is no performance problem with creating a larger 
requests and splitting them.

It would increase code size, not reduce it.

BTW. see fs/bio.c:bio_split --- it uses a shared mempool. It can deadlock 
if the devices depend on each other. You need to use per-queue mempool.
