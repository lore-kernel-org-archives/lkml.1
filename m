BTW, with the increased number of sync IO and unplugging, it makes sense
to soon look into some finer granularity of plugging. If we didn't have
so many single page submission paths it would not be as big a problem,
but we do. And since they still persist so many years after we added
functionality to pass bigger IOs, it likely wont be much better in the
future either.

So we can either look into doing per io context plugging, or doing
something similar to:

plugctx = blk_get_plug_context();
        ...
        submit_bio_plug(rw, bio, plugctx);
        ...
        submit_bio_plug(rw, bio, plugctx);
        ...
blk_submit_plug_context(plugctx);

and pass that down through wbc, perhaps. Dunno, just a thought.
Basically a work-around for not having a dedicated writepages() that
does the right thing (ext3 anyone?).
