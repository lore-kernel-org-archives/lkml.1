Perhaps I've missed something, but surely geometry doesn't make sense on
a >2TB drive does it?  The only reason we use it on modern disks (which
usually make it up specially for us) is that the DOS partition scheme
requires it.  Once we're over 2TB, isn't it impossible to use DOS
partitions (well, OK, unless you increase the sector size, but that's
only delaying the inevitable), so we can just go with a proper disk
labelling scheme and use BLKGETSIZE64 all the time.
