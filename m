Yes, indeed. The farther away the documentation is from the source code
the harder it will be to maintain. That is why I would like to see it in
the linux source tree.

The message tag would be the way to find the translation in some
database from the plain english output you'll find on the screen.

Today I've replaced kmsg_xyz() with pr_xyz(). The current code now plays
tricks with two families of printk macros: dev_xyz() and pr_xyz().
If you ask Greg every device driver should be using dev_xyz() for its
printks anyway..

In that case ALL printk messages would suddenly grow a hash. Which
precludes the use of the component name as part of the message since we
would need to add a component name for every single printk - that won't
happen.
Without a component name we are forced to use a larger number of bits
for the hash to avoid collisions. For 10,000 printks and a 32 bit hash
the likelyhood of a collision is already bigger than 2%, so we'd need
something bigger than 32 bit. With a component name in addition to the
hash you can split the printks into groups which greatly reduces the
danger of a collision.

A dev_xyz() message would then look like this:

<level> <hash>: <driver-name> <device-name>: <the message text>

The prefix is rather lengthy, no ?

The kmsg comments are already formatted in the kernel-doc style and you
can put the comment anywhere in the source file that contains the
printk. The Documentation/ is an extra path where the script looks for
the comments. I can easily drop that part. So yes, the concept is that
you can keep the message comment close to the printk.
