In a way, yes, this is new territory, but not entirely.  It is merely an 
extension of the existing system, and in the existing system the ro flag 
clearly meant do not write to the disk.  You don't extend an existing 
system by breaking old expectations.

Yes, they were the same, and that is my point: users got used to using 
ro to indicate they did not want the block device written to, and were 
doing this long before there was a read only flag on the block device 
itself.  Excepting journal playback from this breaks user expectation 
and leads to data loss.

This is another good example arguing against writing to the disk.  Ext2 
would write to the super block to mark the volume as dirty and update 
the mount count used to decide when it was time for a fsck.  It did not 
do this if mounted read only because it understood that the meaning of 
the ro flag was not to write to the disk.  Likewise, it did not update 
file's atime.  If ro just meant "don't let me write to files" then the 
atime would be updated even when mounted read only.

And this is exactly what you get without journals.  You mount a damaged 
filesystem read only, you take what you can get.  You might get bad 
data, or fail to open or read certain files or parts of files, but you 
knew for sure that you wouldn't cause any more damage to the data on 
disk, and you could run a fsck or defrag or partimage or anything else 
to read and/or modify the disk.

Just because a bug has been around for a long time does not mean it is 
not a bug.  In the pre-journal world, if you mounted a dirty filesystem 
read only you expected the possibility of errors reading it.  Why should 
that expectation not hold true with journals?  It might be nice to do 
the journal playback in ram or otherwise without writing to the disk, 
but as far as the user setting the ro flag cares, they just want you not 
to update the disk and if there are inconsistencies that cause errors, 
then you need to fsck or mount rw.
