I wonder if we might have better luck if we tested using an external 
(e-sata or USB connected) S-ATA drive.

Instead of pulling the drive's data connection, most of these have an 
external power source that could be turned off so the drive firmware 
won't have a chance to flush the volatile write cache. Note that some 
drives automatically write back the cache if they have power and see a 
bus disconnect, so hot unplugging just the e-sata or usb cable does not 
do the trick.

Given the number of cheap external drives, this should be easy to test 
at home....
