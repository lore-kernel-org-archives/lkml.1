So I tried the version in Debian unstable...

The same thing happens with cdparanoia-3.10.2+debian.

But the patch above doesn't help. Now cdparanoia crashes with a segmentation
fault:

| 0x0ffd5730 in cdda_read_timed () from /usr/lib/libcdda_interface.so.0
| (gdb) bt
| #0  0x0ffd5730 in cdda_read_timed () from /usr/lib/libcdda_interface.so.0

| #5  0x0fd468c0 in __libc_start_main () from /lib/libc.so.6
| #6  0x00000000 in ?? ()

due to the `buffer' parameter being NULL.
