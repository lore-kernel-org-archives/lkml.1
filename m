New USB devices can appear at any time.  None are present when the 
system is started; they are all detected dynamically by the khubd 
thread.

While I'm not familiar with the details of any other hotpluggable 
buses (like Firewire), I imagine much the same is true for them.

Suppose there are two USB disk drives attached, and the one containing
the root fs is probed second.  The count could easily drop to 0 when
the first drive has been scanned, especially if scanning is done
synchronously.

What happens when the root fs is on a hotpluggable bus that doesn't use
the SCSI infrastructure?  You'd have to extend your hooks into that
other subsystem as well.

Besides, why do you want to go to all this trouble to find out
_exactly_ when the device containing the root fs becomes available?  
What's wrong with just checking at 1/10-second intervals?

For example, what happens if the USB device containing the root fs
isn't plugged in when the system boots?  The user will quickly realize
that nothing is happening and will then plug it in.  But your code will
already have decided that the device doesn't exist and given up.  
Wouldn't it be better simply to keep on trying, so that then the device 
does get plugged in the system can use it?
