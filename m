Dropping caches (and running sync first) had no effect on the result of 
md5sum.  Hopefully that narrows it down a bit.

Thanks to your prodding though, I have another interesting finding:

If I remove the corrupted file and copy a "known good" copy into it's 
place, then the corruption doesn't happen.  I've verified this a couple 
of times.  The corruption only occurs if the file was created by 
"locale-gen".

I'll continue to try work out why :-).

Thanks
Alan
