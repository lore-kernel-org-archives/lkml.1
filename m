Would that be compatible with md?

Actually, there is an easier way to do this with cfdisk.  Once you know where 
a partition starts, enter it into cfdisk and set the size to something 
short, then save and restart cfdisk. If the position is correct, then cfdisk 
will identify the fs type.  Now exit again and do an fsck, which will error 
out complaining about a dev-size/fs-size mismatch.  Adjust the cfdisk 
partition accordingly, and cycle through the rest of the partitions.

But, I want something much more automated.  And the partition table backup 
per partition entry isn't really a bad idea.


Thanks!
