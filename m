for a laptop you areprobably correct, but for a server or embedded system 
that doesn't have it's hardware changing all the time you are not correct.

especially on a system with lots of drives, why should I have to create an 
initrd that goes and searches dozens or hundreds of drives to find out 
which one to boot from?

I am building a system that will have two drives in a hardware mirror on 
one SCSI card, and 160 drives on a FC (SCSI) card. why should my boot have 
to go and examine all 162 drives to look for an ID on every partition just 
to find the boot drive?

it's great for startup time, but doing the async detection doesn't 
_require_ doing async registration.
