so what sort of test would be needed to identify if a device has this 
problem?

people can do ad-hoc tests by pulling the devices in use and then checking 
the entire device, but something better should be available.

it seems to me that there are two things needed to define the tests.

1. a predictable write load so that it's easy to detect data getting lose

2. some statistical analysis to decide how many device pulls are needed 
(under the write load defined in #1) to make the odds high that the 
problem will be revealed.

with this we could have people test various devices and report if the test 
detects unrelated data being lost (or businesses, and I think the tech 
hardware sites would jump into this given some sort of accepted test)

for USB devices there may be a way to use the power management functions 
to cut power to the device without requiring it to physically be pulled, 
if this is the case (even if this only works on some specific chipsets), 
it would drasticly speed up the testing
