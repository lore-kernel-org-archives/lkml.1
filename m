Hi Linus,
 please pull my md development tree as described below.

 Highlights (for me) are:
   moving .h file from include/linux to driver/md from Christoph.
     I'm already loving the fact that e.g. raid5.h is in the same
     directory as raid5.c :-)
   more options for reshaping arrays including raid5->raid6 and back,
     reducing the number of drives in an array and changing the chunksize.   

  There is lots of other stuff, bug fixes and other feature
  enhancements.
  A small change to md/Makefile touches 'dm' as well, hence Cc to
  Alasdair.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
