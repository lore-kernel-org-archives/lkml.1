Randy, can you post the debug patch you used? The above goes boom when
it attempts to remove a command that isn't on the list, the Qptr in the
last example should be empty, hence the oops. So I'd be interested in
seeing what removeQ() calls this is, I'm assuming it's this bit in
do_cciss_intr():

      ...
              while (c->busaddr != a) {
                       c = c->next;
                       if (c == h->cmpQ)
                               break;
               }
       }
       /*
        * If we've found the command, take it off the
        * completion Q and free it
        */
       if (c->busaddr == a) {
               removeQ(&h->cmpQ, c);
               if (c->cmd_type == CMD_RWREQ) {
                       complete_command(h, c, 0);
                        ...

If so, what part of the c lookup are you hitting - the on that does:

        c = h->cmd_pool + a2;

or the c->busaddr check that his shown above?
