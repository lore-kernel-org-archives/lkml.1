Yes. But will a production server run months without making one single
new dirtied inode? (Just out of curiosity. Not that I'm not willing to
fix this possible issue.:)

Now there are now two possible solutions:
- unconditionally update dirtied_when in redirty_tail();
- keep dirtied_when and redirty inodes to a new dedicated queue.
The first one involves less code, the second one allows more flexible timing.

NFS/XFS could be a good starting point for discussing the
requirements, so that we can reach a suitable solution.
