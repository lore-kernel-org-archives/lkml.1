Btw, both GCC 4.3 and upcoming GCC 4.4 inline the bit-test.  This is what I
used as a testcase (to avoid the single-call and single-constant cases):

#define BITS_PER_LONG 32
static inline int constant_test_bit(int nr, const volatile unsigned long *addr)
{
  return ((1UL << (nr % BITS_PER_LONG)) &
          (((unsigned long *)addr)[nr / BITS_PER_LONG])) != 0;
}

#define test_bit(nr, addr)                      \
    (__builtin_constant_p((nr))             \
     ? constant_test_bit((nr), (addr))      \
     : variable_test_bit((nr), (addr)))

int foo(unsigned long *addr)
{
  return test_bit (5, addr);
}

int bar(unsigned long *addr)
{
  return test_bit (6, addr);
}

at -Os even.

As it happens to work with your simple case it may still apply for more
complex (thus appearantly big) cases.

See below.

We made it so 10 years ago.

Of course.  If you use always_inline then it's even a compiler bug.

We're guessing way better than the average programmer.  But if you are
asking for a compiler option to disable guessing you can have it (you can
already use #define inline always_inline and -fno-inline to get it).
