Not quite, the system determines the limit itself in an adaptive
fashion.

  bdi_limit =3D total_limit * p_bdi

Where p is a faction [0,1], and is determined by the relative writeout
speed of the current BDI vs all other BDIs.

So if you were to have 3 BDIs (sda, sdb and 1 nfs mount), and sda is
idle, and the nfs mount gets twice as much traffic as sdb, the ratios
will look like:

 p_sda: 0
 p_sdb: 1/3
 p_nfs: 2/3

Once the traffic exceeds the write speed of the device we build up a
backlog and stuff gets throttled, so these proportions converge to the
relative write speed of the BDIs when saturated with data.

So what can happen in your case is that the NFS mount is the only one
with traffic is will get a fraction of 1. If it then disconnects like in
your case, it will still have all of the dirty limit pinned for NFS.

However other devices will at that moment try to maintain a limit of 0,
which ends up being similar to a sync mount.

So they'll not get stuck, but they will be slow.
