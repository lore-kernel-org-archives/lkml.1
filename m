mm...  looks like all Matthew's changes were in 2.6.23.  And 2.6.23 worked
OK, yes?


The only recent changes to drivers/scsi/advansys.c are 

commit b80ca4f7ee36c26d300c5a8f429e73372d153379
Author: FUJITA Tomonori <tomof@acm.org>
Date:   Sun Jan 13 15:46:13 2008 +0900

    [SCSI] replace sizeof sense_buffer with SCSI_SENSE_BUFFERSIZE
    
    This replaces sizeof sense_buffer with SCSI_SENSE_BUFFERSIZE in
    several LLDs. It's a preparation for the future changes to remove
    sense_buffer array in scsi_cmnd structure.

gcc inlining is going to make it rather a lot of work to find out which
