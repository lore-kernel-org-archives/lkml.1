I think you need to maintain and support this module out of the kernel tree for
older kernels. Does not make much sense to introduce new interfaces to support
a functionality in older kernels.

- First of all it is more about doing things a new way and not the standard
  way. Moreover upstream does not benefit from this new interface. It just
  stands to loose because of maintenance overhead and need of chaning user
  space tools to make use of this new interface.

- Secondly, personally I think it more twisted also. Following is the
  small code to setup two ioband devices ioband1 and ioband2 and two
  additional groups on ioband1 device using cgroup interface.

***********************************************************************
echo "0 $(blockdev --getsize /dev/sdd1) ioband /dev/sdd1 1 0 0 none"
"weight 0 :200" | dmsetup create ioband1
echo "0 $(blockdev --getsize /dev/sdd2) ioband /dev/sdd2 1 0 0 none"
"weight 0 :100" | dmsetup create ioband2

mount -t cgroup -o blkio hier1 /cgroup/ioband
mkdir /cgroup/ioband/test1 /cgroup/ioband/test2

test1_id=`cat /cgroup/ioband/test1/blkio.id`
test2_id=`cat /cgroup/ioband/test2/blkio.id`

test1_weight=200
test2_weight=100

dmsetup message ioband1 0 type cgroup
dmsetup message ioband1 0 attach $test1_id
dmsetup message ioband1 0 attach $test2_id
dmsetup message ioband1 0 weight $test1_id:$test1_weight
dmsetup message ioband1 0 weight $test2_id:$test2_weight

mount /dev/mapper/ioband1 /mnt/sdd1
mount /dev/mapper/ioband2 /mnt/sdd2
************************************************************************* 

For status of various settings one needs to use "dmsetup status" and
"dmsetup table" commands. Look at the output of these commands with just
two groups. Output for all the groups is on a single line. Think of the
situation when there are 7-8 groups and how bad it will look.

#dmsetup status
ioband2: 0 40355280 ioband 1 -1 105 0 834 1 0 8
ioband1: 0 37768752 ioband 1 -1 105 0 834 1 0 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0

#dmsetup table
ioband2: 0 40355280 ioband 8:50 1 4 192 none weight 768 :100
ioband1: 0 37768752 ioband 8:49 1 4 192 cgroup weight 768 :200 2:200 3:100

I find it so hard to interpre those numbers. Everything about a device is
exported in a single line.

In cgroup based interface, things are deviced nicely among different
files. Also one group shows statistics about that group only and not about
all the groups present in the system. It is easier to parse and
comprehend.

To create the device once you need dm-tools and libcgroup needs to learn 
how to make various use of various dm commands. It also needs to learn how
to parse outputs of "dmsetup table" and "dmsetup status" commands and
consolidate that information.

This is despite the fact that it is using cgroup interface finally to
group the task. But libcgroup still need to propagate cgroup id to
individual ioband devices.
