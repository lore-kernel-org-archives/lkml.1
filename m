As it is my right to do.

There's cleanup and there's cleanup.  Most of the remaining problems
with the bfa driver won't be found by checkpatch and they're not obvious
to a non-storage expert ... but also these aren't major; I just want it
where I can see it to make sure forward progress is being made.

The major area of change for this driver is interfacing it to libfc ...
that's not a staging tree function.  Assuming we can make it work, this
driver will become the first non fcoe consumer of libfc. Likely both
libfc and this driver will have to change as we try this.  Again, it's
not something just anyone can do (in fact, I intend to leave it to the
experts and just referee from the sidelines).

Well, the choir appreciates the sermon.

It's called making an external process serve my purposes.  I'm not
asking anyone else to do this.  However, having a halfway house for
incorrect ABI drivers is a useful additional function which we were
lacking before.

Putting a driver that needs expert cleanup into someone else's tree
seems counter productive to me because it's separating the community of
experts from the driver updates.  I mean, fine for whitespace stuff, and
also fine if we actually have documentation; less so if only the authors
understand the hardware and their patches need monitoring.

Having the SCSI tree update drivers/staging is an OK solution.  However,
at this stage, I don't think the bfa driver is bad enough to be tagged
with the staging taint flag.
