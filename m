It works if I disable USB 2.0 support in the BIOS, does that tell us
anything new? The thing is sold as a USB 2.0 device, does this just
confirm that it's a cheap device which is just lousy quality, or can
it be considered broken?

...

I tried it with my neighbour's computer and there it didn't work either,
so it's just broken hardware it seems.

Oh well, tested one patch today, so it wasn't totally useless.

Thanks for the help,

Indan
