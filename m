No ... you're still not reading the explanation in the thread:

The wait scan module is designed to wait for scans of driver modules.
Whether SCSI=y or m has no effect on this ... you can still have modular
drivers with built in SCSI.

This is actually not in mainline.  It's an incorrect patch in -mm.  The
problem with late_initcall is that they queue in link order ... so any
SCSI module (and there a few) linked after this won't benefit from it.
The obvious hack is to have a separate file with this in the final link.
However, Matthew Wilcox thinks he can do better.
