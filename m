"Devices directories" are not supposed to contain duplicate entries.
It would slow-down, or may even break things.

> or /sys/class/devnums/bMAJ:MIN?

These are no devices belonging to the class "devnums", so it may
confuse things which crawl these directories to get "all devices".
Current coldplug-like setups will likely add duplicate devices with
the wrong subsystem. There are also bus-devices with have a dev_t, and
that will make them show up in /sys/class, which might confuse some
tools too.

I guess we will need to find some other solution as a /sys/class/ for
that. And we must prefix the links with 'c' and 'b' because dev_t is
not unique across char and block devices.
