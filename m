I think there's actually 3 cases:
* Normal write with normal plugging rules
* Write that should be "sync" priority, but which should explicitly NOT
  unplug, even if it otherwise would have happened, because the caller
  will, as part of the contract of the API, do the unplug when all IO
  is submitted.
  (a bit like tcp/cork)
* Write that is sync priority and is the last one of a sequence,
  and thus should unplug immediately.

I can even imagine using a temporary/special queue for the 2nd case,
and then splice that into the regular queue when the final IO comes in,
in one go.
