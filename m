right ... my question was whether this exposed an existing bug that was
hidden by the waiting too much.  Actually, I audited all the async code
and that's impossible: we don't actually have any async domains at all
(except for the spurious superblock s_async_list, which never gets
anything added to its runqueue), so it must be a bug in the code.

Yes, see later fix.  Assuming we get confirmation from the reporter, we
should be good to go.

Well, the other option is to revert the fix ... since there is no other
separated domain, there's nothing really to fix ... the original code
that showed the problem was a SCSI feature tree conversion of our
current async scanning code to the async infrastructure which used a
separate domain.
