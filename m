This is exactly the failure mechanism I described earlier.  The usbmon
log shows that a communications error occurred and usb-storage tried to
carry out error recovery.  The drive apparently did not reset itself,
because when the READ was reissued no data was received.  In fact, the
log _ends_ at the point where the READ was reissued; no more data was
transferred in either direction.  Presumably the next thing to occur
was a command timeout.

And since the block-layer timeout code in 2.6.28-rc2 is known to be
buggy, it's not surprising that the copy process hung at that point.  
It would be better to run this test under 2.6.27; that way we might
learn something new.
