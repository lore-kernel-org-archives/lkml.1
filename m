I got it pinned down.  I'll post the fix after some more testing but it
looks like we'll need more extensive change to get it clean.  The
problem is when the command is passed to driver - at elv_next_request()
or blkdev_dequeue_request().  SCSI thinks it's blkdev_dequeue_request(),
block layer thinks it's elv_next_request() for some purposes while
blkdev_dequeue_request() for others.  I really think we should change
the interface to something like blk_peek_request() and
blk_fetch_request() and don't allow finishing a request which are not
fetched.

Thanks.
