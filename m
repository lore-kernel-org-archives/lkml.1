It's not wrong, but we just have to think through which value is the
most useful.

Any process executing clone(CLONE_NEWPID) (with CAP_SYS_ADMIN) can start
an application in a new pid namespace.  So imagine the user at the
desktop clicking some button which runs an application in a new pid
namespace.  Now if the user starts an xterm and runs ps -ef, the pid
values he'll see for the tasks in that new namespace will not be the
same as those which the application sees for itself, and not the same as
those which, right now, autofs would report.

For instance, if I start a shell in a new pid namespace, then within the
new pid namespace ps -ef gives me:

sh-3.2# ps -ef
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root         1     0  0 10:54 pts/1    00:00:00 /bin/sh
root         5     1  0 10:54 pts/1    00:00:00 /bin/sleep 100
root         6     1  0 10:54 pts/1    00:00:00 ps -ef

but from another shell as the same user, partial output of ps -ef
gives me:

root      2877  2876  0 10:54 pts/1    00:00:00 /bin/sh
root      2881  2877  0 10:54 pts/1    00:00:00 /bin/sleep 100

And so what we're trying to decide is whether autofs should send
pid 5 or pid 2881 for a message about the "/bin/sleep 100" task.

In fact, if the user clicks that button twice, chances are both
instances of the application will have the same pid values for each
process in the application.  So now if autofs sends a message to the
user about the application, the user cannot tell which process is at
fault.

Autofs will be sending the user some message about 'process 5'.  The
user won't know whether it means "the real" pid 5, [watchdog/0],
pid 5 in the first instance of the application, or pid 5 in the
second instance.

Now it's true that the user's xterm may still be in a different
(descendent) pidns of the autofs daemon.  But we can't expect
the autofs daemon to do pid_t translation for the user, so I
think what we have to aim for is making sure that the values
reported are unique within the pidns of the autofs daemon.  And
that means sending back either the pid values in the autofs
daemon's pid namespace, or using the top-level pid_ts, that is,
the pid values in the init namespace, which will be unique
on the whole system.

Sorry this turned out long-winded, I hope it makes sense.
And if I'm just showing a misunderstanding of what you're doing,
please do correct me :)

thanks,
