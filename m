 just to make one thing clear - I am not so much concerned about the
performance of AACRAID. It is OK with or without Mel's patch. It is
better with Mel's patch. The regression in DIO compared to 2.6.19.2 is
completely independent of Mel's stuff.

 What interests me much more is the behaviour of the CCISS+LVM based
system. Here I see a huge benefit of reverting Mel's patch.

 I dirtied the system after reboot as Mel suggested (24 parallel kernel
build) and repeated the tests. The dirtying did not make any
difference. Here are the results:

Test      -rc8    -rc8-without-Mels-Patch
dd1       57      94
dd1-dir   87      86
dd2       2x8.5   2x45
dd2-dir   2x43    2x43
dd3       3x7     3x30
dd3-dir   3x28.5  3x28.5
mix3      59,2x25 98,2x24

 The big IO size with Mel's patch really has a devastating effect on
the parallel write. Nowhere near the value one would expect, while the
numbers are perfect without Mel's patch as in rc1-rc5. To bad I did not
see this earlier. Maybe we could have found a solution for .24.

 At least, rc1-rc5 have shown that the CCISS system can do well. Now
the question is which part of the system does not cope well with the
larger IO sizes? Is it the CCISS controller, LVM or both. I am open to
suggestions on how to debug that. 

Cheers
Martin
