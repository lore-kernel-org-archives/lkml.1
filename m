thanks, data=writeback helps.

Resume: ext3 with data=ordered gets bh with data and moves it to journal
transaction. If transaction handled immediately, ext3 frees bh on this page, and
then frees this page.
However if journal delays processing of this transaction, ext3 cannot free bh
that is still busy. Later jbd layer decrements bh counter but it makes nothing
with data page that is not freed and stays inactive.
