That was before journaling filesystems...

You can object any way you want, but running ext3 on flash or MD RAID5
is stupid:

* ext2 would be faster

* ext2 would provide better protection against powerfail.

"ext3 works on flash and MD RAID5, as long as you do not have
powerfail" seems to be the accurate statement, and if you don't need
to protect against powerfails, you can just use ext2.
