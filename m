It looks like graphic games are pushing the technologies to their
limits, which is good for us. I have bought X38 motherboards for
10 Gbps experimentations, and this chipset is perfectly capable of
feeding two Myri10GE NICs (20 Gbps total). This is 2.5 GB/s, not
counting overhead. So I/O bandwidth is a premium requirement today.

Other chipsets I have tested (945 and 965) were very poor (about 4.7
and 6.5 Gbps respectively if my memory serves me right).
