As the discussion tilts toward SCSI device shutdown.

Indeed, Alan suggested holding the kset spinlock while iterating the
list.  Unfortunately, the device shutdown routines may sleep.  At least
the SCSI sd_shutdown routine issues I/O to the device as part of
flushing device caches.  I would guess other subsystems sleep as well.

I'm not sure.  I'd punt this question to the SCSI maintainers.  From the
FC transport point of view, the rport timeout simply looks like a device
unplug event.  Should the unplug be handled differently if the system
is already shutting down?

Presumably any other subsystem that supports device unplug (usb, for
example) could enter the same race.  But, FCoE devices seem uniquely
poised to provoke the issue in a semi-repeatable fashion.

I'll try klist.  That looks like a good mediator between traversal and
removal.

Thanks,
