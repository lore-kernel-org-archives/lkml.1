Kernel people who don't do storage or file systems will still need a 
summary - making very specific proposals based on real data and analysis 
is useful.

Even if you unmount the file system? Why isn't this an issue with ext2?

Sounds like you want to suggest very specifically that journalled file 
systems are not appropriate for low end flash cards (which seems quite 
reasonable).

Pulling hot any device will cause data loss for recent data loss, even 
with ext2 you will have data in the page cache, right?

Many people in the real world who use RAID5 (for better or worse) use 
external raid cards or raid arrays, so you need to be very specific.

Degraded is one faulted drive while MD is doing a rebuild? And then you 
hot unplug it or power cycle? I think that would certainly cause failure 
for ext2 as well (again, you would lose any data in the page cache).

What you are describing is a double failure and RAID5 is not double 
failure tolerant regardless of the file system type....

I don't want to be overly negative since getting good documentation is 
certainly very useful. We just need to be document things correctly 
based on real data.
