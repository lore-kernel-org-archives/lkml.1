I'm pretty sure we discussed this some months ago, the intel iommu
driver had a similar bug iirc. Lets say you want to write the same 4kb
block to two spots on the disk. You prepare and submit that with
O_DIRECT and using aio. On a device with NCQ, that could easily map the
same page twice. Or, perhaps more likely, doing 512b writes and not
getting all of them merged.

Seems so.
