That makes sense.

This is likely coming from lockd_down(), and is almost certainly not
coming from the same uts namespace as the lockd_up() that did the
pmap_set, which was done by the first NFS mount done in the first uts
namespace on the system.  It's just something that the kernel has to
do for maintenance.

There is only one lockd() instance that is shared among all the uts
namespaces, right?  In this case, what is the correct utsname to use?
