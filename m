Well, for that case, you just never enable async scanning

But also, the sysfs with over 4,000 (and higher) devices was
specifically checked by OSDL (actually as part of the CGL testing) some
of the Manoj changes (for unpinning entries etc) were needed to get it
to function, but as of now, I believe an enterprise scaling test works
reasonably well for it ... there certainly wasn't any evidence of it
dying horribly in the tests.
