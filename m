is it under all conditions, or only when you have already lost redundancy?

prior discussions make me think this was only if the redundancy is already 
lost.

also, the talk about software RAID 5/6 arrays without journals will be 
confusing (after all, if you are using ext3/XFS/etc you are using a 
journal, aren't you?)

you then go on to talk about hardware raid 5/6 without battery backup. I'm 
think that you are being too specific here. any array without battery 
backup can lead to 'interesting' situations when you loose power.

in addition, even with a single drive you will loose some data on power 
loss (unless you do sync mounts with disabled write caches), full data 
journaling can help protect you from this, but the default journaling just 
protects the metadata.
