Yes. Unfortunately, different filesystems expect different properties
from block devices. ext3 will work with write cache enabled/barriers
enabled, while ext2 needs write cache disabled.

The requirements are also quite surprising; AFAICT ext3 can handle
disk writing garbage to single sector during powerfail, while xfs can
not handle that.

Now, how do you expect users to know these subtle details when it is
not documented anywhere? And why are you fighting against documenting
these subtleties?

As was uncovered, MD RAID does not properly support barriers,
so... you don't actually need drive failure.

Trust me, 99% of sysadmins are not compentent by your definition. So
this should be documented.

ext3 greatly contributes to administrator incomentency:

# The journal supports the transactions start and stop, and in case of a
# crash, the journal can replay the transactions to quickly put the
# partition back into a consistent state.

...it does not mention that (non-default!) barrier=1 is needed to make
this reliable, nor it mentions that there are certain requirements for
this to work. It just says that journal will magically help you.

And you wonder while people expect magic from your filesystem?
