I see. If we override this in hpsa_scsi_detect(), we need a trick for
SG in CommandList_struct, I guess.

Yeah, looks like it needs a fix.

These drivers are bad. Well, in ancient times dma_map_sg never failed
on X86. So BUG_ON or ignoring is acceptable for drivers for ancient
systems.

But nowadays dma_map_sg can fail (e.g. with Intel VT-D IOMMU).

Not. It's a temporary error, kinda out-of-memory. So we want to retry.
returning SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY is appropriate here.

I see, please drop this. This is an issue that we need to take care
about before mainline merging.

I see. Seems that some drivers want something similar. I might come
back later on with a patch to replace this with library
functions.
