Hi James,

   Well, it didn't touch any drivers.  The only ones which needed altering 
were those which wanted to use large scatter-gather lists.  You think of the 
subtlety of sg-chain conversion as a feature; it's a bug :)

Actually, I think it's a wash.  Now callers need to set up an sg_table as 
well.  It will save the count_sg() calls though.

James, scatterlists are used for more than the block subsystem.  I know you're 
designing for that, but we can do better.

    Because a single sg_ring is trivially convertable to and from a 
scatterlist *, the compatibility story is nice.  You can implement a 
subsystem (say, the block layer) with sg_ring, and still hand out struct 
scatterlist arrays for backwards compat: old code won't ask for v. long 
scatterlist arrays anyway.

    Now we have sg_chaining, we can actually convert complex sg_rings into sg 
chains when someone asks, as my most recent patch does.  I think that's one 
abstraction too many, but it provides a transition path.

But you've overloaded the type: what's the difference between:
	/* Before conversion */
	int foo(struct scatterlist *, int);
And:
	/* After conversion */
	int foo(struct scatterlist *, int);

You have to wade through the implementation to see the difference: does this 
function take a "chained scatterlist" or an "array scatterlist"?

Then you add insult to injury by implementing sg_chain() *which doesn't handle 
chained scatterlists!*.

But it would have started with none of them, and it would have been done over 
time.  Eventually we might have had a flag day to remove raw scatterlist 
arrays.

Yes.

ATA wants to chain sgs (Tejun cc'd).  It hasn't been practical to chain up 
until now, but I'd say it's going to be more widely used now it is.

Basically, sg_chain solves one problem: larger sg lists for scsi.  That's 
fine, but I want to see better use of scatterlists everywhere in the kernel.

sg_chains suck for manipulation, and AFAICT that's inherent.  Here, take a 
look at the sg_ring conversion of scsi_alloc_sgtable and scsi_free_sgtable 
and you can see why I'm unhappy with the sg_chain code:
