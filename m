Vp does not happen in the current implementation. But it actually may be
useful. z/VM has multiple layers of paging, the first goes to expanded
storage which is very fast. If you make the page Vz and the guests needs
it you have to do a standard Linux I/O to get retrieve the page. This
can be slower than a read and a write to expanded storage.

You get an addressing exception if you touch a Uz page. This indicates a
BUG in the Linux code because this is a use after free. If the guests
touches a Vz page you get a discard fault.
