VL is vesa local ... it was an ISA like graphics bus that was fast and

It will definitely work for EISA and VL bus.  I think if you analyse the
placement of kernel data segments for compiled in drivers, it might also
work for ISA too, since I think the pfn will be low enough.  It should
fail as a module not just because the area will be out of range for ISA,
but also because the module data segment is in vmalloc space, so the
virt_to_bus assumptions of contiguity could be violated.
