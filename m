Ted, you probably need some slab debugging on to hit it.

I think the problem is that jbd2_journal_commit_transaction may call
__jbd2_journal_drop_transaction(journal, commit_transaction) if the
checkpoint lists are NULL, and this frees the commit_transaction.

However, the call to ->j_commit_callback() tries to use it after that.

I'm out of time for now to be sure this is the right fix, but something
like this perhaps?

Also, I'm not certain that it matters, but the loop in 
release_blocks_on_commit() is kfreeing list entries w/o taking
them off the list; I suppose maybe this is safe if the whole thing
is getting discarded when we're done, but just to keep things sane,
would this make sense (also, I think we need to double-check use of
s_md_lock; it's taken when adding things to the list, but not when
freeing/removing ... if it's needed, isn't it needed on both ends...):
