Heh, it's one of the endearing faults of the storage industry that we
never learn from our mistakes ... particularly in storage protocols.

Actually, perhaps that's a mischaracterised: we never actually learn
from our successes.  For example, most popular storage protocols solve
about 80% of the problem (NFSv2) get something bolted on to take that to
95% (locking) and rule for decades.  We end up obsessing about the 5%
and produce something that's like 10x the overhead to solve it.
Customers, for some unfathomable reason, hate complexity  (I suspect
principally because it in some measure equals expense) so the 100%
solution (which actually turns out to be a 95% one because the over
engineered complexity adds another 5% of different problems that take
years to find) tends to work its way into a niche and stay there ...
eventually fading.

If you're really lucky, the niche evolves into something sustainable.
For example iSCSI: blew its early promise, pulled a bunch of unnecessary
networking into the protocol and ended up too big to fit in disk
firmware (thus destroying the ability to have a simple network tap to
replace storage fabric).  It's been slowly fading until Virtualisation
came along.  Now all the other solutions to getting storage into virtual
machines are so horrible and arcane that iSCSI looks like a winner (if
the alternative is Frankenstein's monster, Grendel's mother suddenly
looks more attractive as a partner).

So, trust the customer ... if it's so horrible it shouldn't have seen
the light of day, the chances are that no-one will buy it anyway.
