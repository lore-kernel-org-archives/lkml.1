Actually, I think the new scsi request infrastructure should be doing
the bouncing (rather than have it done in each problem path we
discover).

Mike Christie tells me we're missing bouncing by accident in the
scsi_execute path (but not the scsi_execute_async path).  He says this
is the fix he proposed:

http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=115981479822790&w=2

Can we just merge this instead?
