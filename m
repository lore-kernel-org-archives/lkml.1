I'm not really sure how this is different than a malicious app going off 
and spawning thousands of threads in an attempt to hit a target pid from 
a security pov.  Sure, it makes it easier, but it's not like there is 
anything in place to close the attack vector.

In some instances such as ours, TCP is probably the easiest thing to 
migrate.  In an rpc-based cluster application, TCP is nothing more than 
an RPC channel and applications already have to handle RPC channel 
failure and re-establishment.

I agree that this is not the 'general case' as you mention above 
however.  This is the bit that sorta bothers me with the way the 
implementation has been going so far on this list.  The implementation 
that folks are building on top of Oren's patchset tries to be everything 
to everybody.  For our purposes, we need to have the flexibility of 
choosing *how* we checkpoint.  The line seems to be arbitrarily drawn at 
the kernel being responsible for checkpointing and restoring all 
resources associated with a task, and leaving userland with nothing more 
than transporting filesystem bits.  This approach isn't flexible enough: 
  Consider the case where we want to stub out most of the TCP file 
descriptors with ECONNRESETed sockets because we know that they are RPC 
sockets and can re-establish themselves, but we want to use some other 
mechanism for TCP sockets we don't know much about.  The current 
monolithic approach has zero flexibility for doing anything like this, 
and I figure out how we could even fit anything like this in.

This sort of problem is pushing me to wanting all this stuff to live up 
in userland.  The 'core dump'ish way of checkpointing is a great way to 
prototype some of the requirements, but it's going to end up being 
pretty difficult to do anything interesting long term and this is going 
to stifle any chance of this getting productized in our environments.

This is a bit ridiculous.  This is akin to asking programs to recognize 
that their heap addresses may change.
