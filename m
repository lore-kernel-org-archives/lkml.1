I'm completely confused by the block layer API, to be honest.  Trying to
deduce how to add a new feature at this stage is hard (compare it to
adding the reflink operation to the VFS ...).  I'm definitely willing to
tackle changing the block device API, but it may take a while.

I'm not sure we need option 3b.

I can certainly prototype a replacement for discard_prep_fn along these lines.
