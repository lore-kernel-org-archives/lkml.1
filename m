Last time I looked, the database write + fsync case did not result in
a journal commit in some cases, and therefore no blkdev_issue_flush().
The problem was one of correctness.  Has this been fixed?

A database had no way to issue a hard disk barrier in these cases
without doing weird stuff like forcing metadata changes prior to fsync
(e.g. toggling permissions bits), which causes an intolerable two disk
seeks per fsync.  That is _way_ expensive.

There is also no way in ext3 to _just_ fdatasync() (no metadata even
if it has changed), with disk barrier/flush.

Imho a good place to call blkdev_issue_flush() is in the VFS, after
it's written all the data blocks, unless the filesystem has a better
override.  That would work with most filesystems automatically.
Request queue optimisations may trivially remove redundant flushes.
