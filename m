Matt Domsch spoke with me about this at OLS.  I took that opportunity,
and I'll take this one, to pimp my ata-ram driver which allows you to
alter the sector sizse to whatever you want:

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/willy/misc.git;a=shortlog;h=ata-ram

I'll admit to having not tested it with anything other than 512, but it
ought to support 4096 byte sectors just fine.  I haven't looked at what
would be required to support 520-byte sectors.

Jeff, any interest in merging ata-ram soon?  I've got some users inside
Intel, and Zab persuaded me to add the multiple port support last night,
so it's not just useful for me.  I think it's also a nice template to
have around to show how to write a minimal libata driver.

Intel are signing my paycheques ... these opinions are still mine
"Bill, look, we understand that you're interested in selling us this
operating system, but compare it to ours.  We can't possibly take such
a retrograde step."
