Most of them aren't very.  They're usually things that are set at driver
intialisation time (shared mailbox memory etc).

If the allocation is performance sensitive and has to be done at command
or ioctl submission time, we tend to feed the consistent or mapped
memory into a dma pool which pre allocates and solves the performance
issue.

In the aacraid case, the mbox is done at ioctl time, but isn't
incredibly performance sensitive.
