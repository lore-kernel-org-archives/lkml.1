Should be no problem to fix that.

Yes, definitely, though this value varies from controller to controller,
so this is just a default value that needs to be overridden, probably
in hpsa_scsi_detect().

Yes, we should do that.  BTW, the comments in include/linux/scsi_host.h
don't do a very good job of describing exactly what use_clustering is for,
they say:
        /*
         * True if this host adapter can make good use of clustering.
         * I originally thought that if the tablesize was large that it
         * was a waste of CPU cycles to prepare a cluster list, but
         * it works out that the Buslogic is faster if you use a smaller
         * number of segments (i.e. use clustering).  I guess it is
         * inefficient.
         */

It never actually tells you what is meant by "clustering"

Yeah, that should be no problem.  I was thinking as I typed that 
code in, "there's probably some way already defined to do this",
meaning to fix it later, but then I forgot to fix it.

Grepping around a bit in drivers scsi I see some drivers do this:

	SCpnt->result = DID_ERROR << 16;
	
	then call the scsi done function,

some drivers call BUG_ON() when scsi_dma_map() returns -1,
and some do nothing.

I'm guessing setting result = DID_ERROR << 16 and calling
the done function is the way to go, right?

Oh, ok.  I think maybe that didn't exist when I first wrote that code.

Ok.

Yeah, we shouldn't run out.  That check is kind of paranoia.

We can take it out.  We figured we'd take it out when
someone complained, which we figured would probably
happen pretty much immediately.

Hmm, this doesn't seem all that complicated to me, and this code snippet
has been pretty stable for about 10 years. it's nearly identical to what's in
cpqarray in the 2.2.13 kernel from 1999:

                do {
                        i = find_first_zero_bit(h->cmd_pool_bits, NR_CMDS);
                        if (i == NR_CMDS)
                                return NULL;
                } while(test_and_set_bit(i%32, h->cmd_pool_bits+(i/32)) != 0)

It's fast, works well, and has needed very little maintenance over the 
years.  Without knowing what you have in mind specifically, I don't see a
big need to change this.
