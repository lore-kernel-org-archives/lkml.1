Jeff:

This brings up an interesting issue with the RDMA transport and
RDMA_READ. RDMA_READ is submitted as part of fetching an RPC from the
client (e.g. NFS_WRITE). The xpo_recvfrom function doesn't block waiting
for the RDMA_READ to complete, but rather queues the RPC for subsequent
processing when the I/O completes and returns 0. 

I can use these new services to allocate CPU local pages for this I/O.
So far, so good. However, when the I/O completes, and the transport is
rescheduled for subsequent RPC completion processing, the pool/CPU that
is elected doesn't have any affinity for the CPU on which the I/O was
initially submitted. I think this means that the svc_process/reply steps
may occur on a CPU far away from the memory in which the data resides.

Am I making sense here? If so, any thoughts on what could/should be
done?

Thanks,
Tom
