Ok, here is the commit:

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/nab/lio-core-2.6.git;a=commit;h=d1dc1c1da8375c1b9099166d7d93f7f45477f892

In the example I am using two iSCSI Initiators (one Debian and one
OpenSuse) that both have TPG LUN 0 and 1 mapped to their Initiator LUN 0
and 1 under $FABRIC/$IQN/tpgt_1.

Here is what it looks like from the CLI:

export TARGET=/sys/kernel/config/target/core/
export FABRIC=/sys/kernel/config/target/iscsi/

echo 1 > $FABRIC/$DEF_IQN/tpgt_1/enable


And running....

Anyways, you get the idea.  The primary functionality is up for getting
ACLs iSCSI Initiator Nodes and LUNs symlinked to TPG LUNs symlinked to
$STORAGE_OBJECTs from target_core_mod.   I will be continuing to convert
stuff from the IOCTL, mostly things that need to be made into configfs
attributes.  I am going to focus on the getting the remaining stuff
under configfs up for iscsi_target_mod, and start looking at the much
larger todo item of seeing how we can merge target_core_mod and scst
core..  Please have a look and let me know what you think (espically the
target_core_mod parts), and I will pull the latest SCST code and start
looking at the FABRIC <-> TARGET you mentioned..
