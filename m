I wasn't clear enough. I meant the class of the process as set by ionice, not
the class of the cgroup. That is, of course, only an issue when using CFQ.

Setup:

$ mount -t cgroup -o io,blkio none /cgroup
$ mkdir /cgroup/test1 /cgroup/test2 /cgroup/test3
$ echo 1000 > /cgroup/test1/io.weight
$ echo 1000 > /cgroup/test2/io.weight
$ echo 1000 > /cgroup/test3/io.weight

Test:
$ echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

$ ionice -c 1 dd if=/tmp/io-controller-test3 of=/dev/null &
$ echo $! > /cgroup/test1/tasks

$ ionice -c 2 dd if=/tmp/io-controller-test1 of=/dev/null &
$ echo $! > /cgroup/test2/tasks

$ ionice -c 3 dd if=/tmp/io-controller-test2 of=/dev/null &
$ echo $! > /cgroup/test3/tasks
