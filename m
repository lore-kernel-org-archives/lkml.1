Okay, I was thinking SG_IO will return error for rq failures and I
remember pretty clearly following the failure path recently while
debugging eject problem but my memory is pretty unreliable.
Checking... oops, yeap, you're right.

I was confused that rq failure would cause error return from SG_IO.
Sorry about that.  There still is a problem tho.  Buffer for a bounced
SG_IO request is copied back on failure but when a bounced kernel PC
request fails, the data is not copied back in bio_copy_kern_endio().
This is what would break Boaz's code.

So, it seems what we should do is

1. Always copy back bounced buffer whether the request failed or not.
   Whether resid_len should be considered while copying back, I'm not
   sure about given that resid_len isn't properly implemented in some
   drivers.

2. Revert the original behavior of setting resid_len to full on
   request issue and audit the affected code paths.

How does it sound?

Thanks.
