The whole thing is lame by design.

As a consequence, the code for splitting these page-sized bios is being 
duplicated in md, dm and request-based device (and maybe in other drivers).

And there is a long standing unfixable bug --- adding a device to raid1 
may fail if the device has smaller request size than the other raid1 leg.
Think about this:

* thread 1:
bio_add_page() -> returns ok
...
bio_add_page() -> returns ok
* scheduling to thread 2 *
* thread 2:
add a raid1 leg to the block device
* scheduling to thread 1 *
* thread 1:
submit_bio() --- the bio already oversized for the new raid1 leg and there 
is no way to shrink it.


I think it should be redesigned in this way:
* the bio should be allowed to have arbitrary size, up to BIO_MAX_PAGES
* the code for splitting bios should be just at one place --- in the 
generic block layer and it should work with all drivers. I.e.
q->make_request_fn will return that the request is too big for the given 
driver and the generic code will allocate few another bios from 
per-request_queue mempool and split the bio.
* then, we would fix the raid1 bug and we would also simplify md and dm 
--- remove the splitting code.
