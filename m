I should note here I'm not trying to be argumentative, I just want to
understand.  Ok so journal_commit_transaction() will make sure all the
handle_t's are removed and such before processing the revoke lists, but right
before we process the revoke lists we set the journals running transaction to
NULL, which means we can continue on our merry way.  AFAICS the revoke lists are
per journal, not per transaction, so once we give up the j_state_lock after
having made sure the handle_t's had done their thing, we set the
running_transaction to NULL letting people continue to do their thing, and since
the revoke table is on a per journal basis, its completely valid for a new
transaction to be started, a handle to be added to it, journal_cancel_revoke()
to be run against that handle while still in journal_commit_transaction().  It
wouldn't necessarily be a handle_t from the transaction we are in the middle of
committing, it would be from a new transaction, and since the revoke list is per
journal, both the transaction thats currently being committed and the new
transaction would have access to the same revoke list, hence the race.  Is this
correct?  If not let me know because I want to understand this code better.
Thank you,

Josef
