Sorry for later response, hope we can make it in -33-rc
I just have time update the patch based on your comments
and known issues not fixed in previous patch.

Good point. There are a lot of such kind of Macros in IA64
architecture waiting thoroughly clean up. May I update this

I'm sorry for this. Please apply attached patch.

Without dynamic allocation both in Lockdep code and
ia64 architecture in place, 13 bits requires far moe
size than ia64 can support in Per CPU area (1M)

Tony, is it correct?

Updated in new patch. But Temporarily commented out in call site.
I tested it, but there is lock held before leaving kernel...
Will root cause, and fix the problem later.

Updated some in assembly code that modify PSR.I bit.
But not all, because not all modifications of PSR.i bit
would be interesting to lockdep code..

Tested, yes.

Good point, I need to find out place to insert
nmi_enter and nmi_exit., and do some testing.
Not done yet.

Will update in an incremental patch after the patch is accepted.
