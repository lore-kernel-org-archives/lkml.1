Well, I must say I slightly agree that my gut feeling is that we should 
try to avoid arrays which size depends on NR_CPUS as much as possible.

Now, what to do for 2.6.32? We definitely need some kind of fix for this, 
otherwise the Altix guys would kill us.

Tony, is the change that will eventually have to be made to ia64 pagefault 
handler too intrusive for -rc6, and should we rather go with my workaround 
instead, and try to find something proper for 2.6.33?

Pure revert of 34d76c41 isn't possible as well, as it fixes a real bug.
