You lost me. Why does rt needs to patch scsi_io_completion at all?
You should remove any rt patches that modify scsi_lib.c and revert to
vanilla 2.6.29-rc6 (scsi wise that is).

The above diff looks like something that was sent in the past to the mailing
list, but only half of it. It was sent by Alan Stern. It might patch but
it is not applicable any more because of changes made since.
