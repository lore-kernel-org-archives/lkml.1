Hi,

Thank you for the patch.
I have applied the patch to 2.6.23.14 and it works well.

- In case of 2.6.23.14, the problem is reproduced.
- In case of 2.6.23.14 with this patch, raid1 works well so far.
  The fault injection script continues to run, and it doesn't deadlock.
  I will keep it running for a while.

Also, md raid10 seems to have the same problem.
I will test raid10 applying this patch as well.
