Looking good...

I agree; I don't think there's any particular need for the 'dev' suffix.
It's already dependent on CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL, after all.

If a better option is forthcoming, by all means use it -- but I wouldn't
see the existing version as a barrier to merging.


One more thing I'd suggest is removing the INSTALL file. The parts about
having to build libcrc32c aren't relevant when it's part of the kernel
tree and you have 'select LIBCRC32C', and the documentation on the
userspace utilities probably lives _with_ the userspace repo. Might be
worth adding a pointer to the userspace utilities though, in
Documentation/filesystems/btrfs.txt

I think you can drop your own copy of the GPL too.
