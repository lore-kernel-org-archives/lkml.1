It's not an option 64_BIT builds.

Is there any way to tell the user what device (or partition?) is
bein skipped?  This printk should just print (confirm) that
node_detected_dev is NULL.  Shouldn't it just print <dev> in
major:minor format?

Drop "signed", like the surrounding code.
Leave a blank line between data declarations and beginning of code.

include/linux/kernel.h has INT_MAX, UINT_MAX, LONG_MAX, ULONG_MAX,
LLONG_MAX, ULLONG_MAX.
