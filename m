They applied cleanly to the ubuntu 10.04 2.6.32 kernel source package but 
when compiling I received an error about "sas_change_queue_depth" having 
wrong amount of arguments:

-		sas_change_queue_depth(sdev, MVS_QUEUE_SIZE);
+		sas_change_queue_depth(sdev, MVS_QUEUE_SIZE, SCSI_QDEPTH_DEFAULT);

So I removed that change and then things compiled, booted properly, but 
just froze when I plugged in the disks (including some garbled graphics on 
my X screen). That patch set doesn't seem to be ok.
