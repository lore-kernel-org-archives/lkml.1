On my wishlist to Justin is also what is the performance of the raid10's
in degraded mode.

And then I note that raid1 performs well on random seeks 702/s
while the raid10,f2 (my pet) only performs 520/s - but this is on a
2.6.23 kernel without the seek performance patch for raid10,f2.

I wonder if the random seeks are related to random read (and write) - it
probably is, but there seems to be a difference between the results
found with bonnie++ and my tests as reported on the
http://linux-raid.osdl.org/index.php/Performance page.
