I don't see this race.

We can't call nfs_callback_down() until after nfs_callback_up()
returns, so we're guaranteed to have "task" set to a valid task
(presuming that nfs_callback_up() doesn't return error). We also can't
return from nfs_callback_down() until after the nfs_callback_svc() has
exited. kthread_stop() will block until it does.

I suppose that makes just as much sense. It also seems more symmetrical
given that we also set the var in nfs_callback_up(). I'll roll that into
the BKL removal patch, and give it some testing. Look for it in a day
or two...
