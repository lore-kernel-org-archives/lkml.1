Heh, so I guess that means that you cannot show me where in
lio-core-2.6.git that the issues still exist.  Why am I not suprised..? 

Can you at least even back up your claim that the 10 month old BUGs you
posted have not been fixed, or was that just handwaving as well. Again
Bart, the only reason took a bit of extra time responding to you
because:

1) I was busy helping other people, and
2) The of the disrespectful tone of your emails turns me off

If this is the reasoning you cite for ignoring and badmouthing
Target_Core_Mod/ConfigFS, LIO-Target v3.0 and myself to the kernel
community at large, and making false claims about LIO stability (without
looking at an code, by your own admission!?), all I can say is:  WoW!!

Heh, and posting URLs to 10 month old BUGs that have been fixed 10
months ago in v2.9 on-topic for the Target_Core_Mod/ConfigFS v3.0
discussion..?

Like I said, if you would spend a fraction of the time you use trying to
discredit LIO code on trying to understand ConfigFS, or my points why I
decided not to use SCST as a base for Target_Core_Mod, perhaps you would
be apple to make real comments on worthwhile comments here, instead of
just your usual handwaving.

The point is that neither you nor Vlad would acknowledge any of the
issues on that thread, or communicate with me in a professional manner
without the handwaving.  How do you expect me to work with you if you
can't even acknowledge the short comings, or offer me a roadmap to get
them resolved when all you guys do is handwave..?

I think that your definition of Zero-copy as "data is copied as few
times as possible" speaks for itself.  I don't exactly know how that can
be taken out of context.  Of course, that was just the tip of the
iceberg on that thread.  Lets not even get into how you claimed RDMA
meant only userspace ops on virtual memory addresses using a vendor
specific API, or that RDMA using virtual addresses would be
communicating with drivers/scsi or block/ (which obviously use struct
page).

So honestly, I was much more concerned about the responses I got from
you and Vlad about core SCST core lacking important functionality for
$FABRIC_MODs using generic target infrastructure, and your inability to
acknowledge anything that you cannot or do not want to understand when
it comes to interface with linux storage subsystems  in the context on
generic target mod.

Do you actually think people care about hearing that it look me an extra
day to address your issue 10 months ago..?  :-) If you honestly think me
talking an extra day to address your issue (while I was busy with other
things at the same time) has any relivance to the upstream code
discussion, your are sorely mistaken.

Bart, no one wants to hear us argue, that is why I am saving them the
pain and removing them from the CC list.  Any until you can start
showing me some real techincal content in a professional manner, I am
going to simply ignore your clumsy attempts at attacking me and m work.
