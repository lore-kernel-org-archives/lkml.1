Yes, the comment is wrong, thanks for noticing. That is how it's implemented.

No, parallel writes that affect the same metadata sectors will not be allowed.
At the moment there is a rough lock which does not allow simultaneous updates
at all, I plan to make that more fine-grained in the future.

Note that bios that affect more than one sector are just fine, since the
metadata sector will be properly updated.

Thanks,
