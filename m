Nobody said you had to have the exact same driver for every hypervisor.
What people are suggesting is that we look at commonalities in the
interfaces both from a control plane point of view (transport class) and
from a code sharing point of view (libscsivirt).  However, all the
hypervisor interfaces I've seen are basically DMA rings ... they really
do seem to be very similar across hypervisors, so it does seem there
could be a lot of shared commonality.  I'm not going to insist on RDMA
emulation, but perhaps you lot should agree on what a guest to
hypervisor DMA interface looks like.
