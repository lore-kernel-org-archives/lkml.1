Also "contrary to or forbidden by official rules, regulations, etc".
So word meanings are like standards, there are so many to choose
from.

The error messages are therefore incorrect as so far nobody has

Most USB mass storage implementations should result in jail
terms for the responsible parties.

Please don't do this.

Several reasons:
  1) Those strings appear in an international standard.
     In this case SPC-3 ANSI INCITS 408-2005.
  2) The way that INCITS standard (and others) is structured,
     the relevant part of the text refers to a specific
     additional sense code + qualifier instance by _name_
     (e.g. "Illegal command while in write capable state")
     not by number (e.g. 0x20,0x4). So given the Alan Cox
     rendition of that string in a log, a diligent debugger
     would need to get to constants.c to find the corresponding
     asc/ascq numeric sequence, then search Annex D of SPC-3
     to find the t10.org version of that string, then search
     the body of SPC-3 and other t10 device class specific
     standards for a match on the t10 string.
     Vendor product manuals would tend to use the t10.org
     strings as well.
  3) I maintain constants.c and I do that with the help
     of a program that compares t10's tables (specifically
     http://www.t10.org/lists/asc-num.txt ) with the table
     in constants.c . I'm glad to send you a copy so you
     can take over maintaining the sanitized list and
     cope with the abuse that may follow.


If you feel strongly about this then you could take it
up with ANSI or BS (a great acronym IMO).
