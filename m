Thank you for good information.
I will elevate XFS_IOC_FREEZE and XFS_IOC_THAW to the VFS.

I see.

My following freeze ioctl never perform the timeout when 0 is specified
as timeval.  So, existent applications which don't expect the timeout
can stay frozen with 0.
 int ioctl(int fd, int FIFREEZE, long *timeval);
    fd:file descriptor of mountpoint
    FIFREEZE:request cord for freeze
    timeval:timeout period (second)

And how about adding the new ioctl to reset the timeval like below?
(Dmitri proposed this idea before.)
 int ioctl(int fd, int FIFREEZE_RESET_TIMEOUT, long *timeval);
    fd:file descriptor of mountpoint
    FIFREEZE_RESET_TIMEOUT:request cord for reset of timeout period 
    timeval:new timeout period
This is useful for the application to set the timeval more accurately.
For example, the freezer resets the timeval to 10 seconds every 5
seconds.  In this approach, even if the freezer causes a deadlock
by accessing the frozen filesystem, it will be solved by the timeout
in 10 seconds and the freezer can recognize that at the next reset
of timeval.

Any comments are very welcome.

Cheers, Takashi
