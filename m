Looking back at the mailing list history, yes, we did.  I think the
reason why we didn't was Andrew had expressed a vague wish that the
ext4 and xfs developers would get together and try to hash out a
common layer that all filesystems could work with.  But given that
nothing has happened in the many months since that discussion, you're
absolutely right.

I've reworked the vfs generic patch in the patch series to be much
smaller --- mainly what's left is simply exporting some mpage
interfaces that would be needed by ext4.  I trust this is much more to
your liking?

commit 2962918ce8fa666bdab5b189cc4ed4b3d08a33f8
Author: Alex Tomas <alex@clusterfs.com>

    vfs: add hooks for ext4's delayed allocation support
    
    Export mpage_bio_submit() and __mpage_writepage() for the benefit of
    ext4's delayed allocation support.   Also change __block_write_full_page
    so that if buffers that have the BH_Delay flag set it will call
    get_block() to get the physical block allocated, just as in the
    !BH_Mapped case.
