Uhm. I applied a test-patch from Alan Stern, to possibly fix an 
SCSI lockup with aic7xxx that _I_ reported to you and then to 
the scsi-list.

You were Cc:-ed to that test patch and to my bugreport as well, 
all the way. Do you claim that you dont remember it?

The saga is still documented in tip:out-of-tree (which is a 
special branch with out-of-tree hotfixes):

 7e4cbd1: fix "scsi: aic7xxx hang since v2.6.28-rc1"
 e027abc: scsi: temporarily undo scsi reverts
 813104e: Revert "[SCSI] simplify scsi_io_completion()"
 84db545: Revert "[SCSI] Fix uninitialized variable error in scsi_io_completion"
 0eb6038: Revert "[SCSI] Fix error handling for DIF/DIX"
 3cd94dd: Revert "[SCSI] scsi_lib: don't decrement busy counters when inserting commands"
 c27aed5: Revert "[SCSI] scsi_lib: fix DID_RESET status problems"

I wasnt Cc:-ed on the updated patch AFAICS, so i didnt pick it 
up.

Believe me, i have better things to do than to track down your 
regressions. I applied a fix/test patch sent to me by SCSI 
folks.
