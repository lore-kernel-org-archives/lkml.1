Agreed as well -- compilers would also be within their right to bypass
the rcu_dereference() around the test/prefetch, which would allow
them to refetch.  For example, with __list_for_each_rcu(), the original
implementation allows the compiler to treat a use of "pos" within the body
of the loop as if it was a use of (head)->next, refetching if convenient.
Not so good.

So good catch, Linus!!!

Could we also eliminate the (both unused in 2.6.25 and useless as
well) list_for_each_safe_rcu()?  After all, if you use list_del_rcu()
and call_rcu(), all the RCU list-traversal primitives are "safe" in
this sense.  Patch attached (testing in progress), based on Linus's
earlier patch.
