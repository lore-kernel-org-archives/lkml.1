Sorry I still don't get it. The timing used to be:

write 4MB   ==> WRITE block 0 (ie. first 512KB)
                WRITE block 1
                WRITE block 2
                WRITE block 3         ack from server for WRITE block 0 => mark 0 as unstable (inode marked need-commit)
                WRITE block 4         ack from server for WRITE block 1 => mark 1 as unstable
                WRITE block 5         ack from server for WRITE block 2 => mark 2 as unstable
                WRITE block 6         ack from server for WRITE block 3 => mark 3 as unstable
                WRITE block 7         ack from server for WRITE block 4 => mark 4 as unstable
                                      ack from server for WRITE block 5 => mark 5 as unstable
write_inode ==> COMMIT blocks 0-5
                                      ack from server for WRITE block 6 => mark 6 as unstable (inode marked need-commit)
                                      ack from server for WRITE block 7 => mark 7 as unstable 

                                      ack from server for COMMIT blocks 0-5 => mark 0-5 as clean

write_inode ==> COMMIT blocks 6-7

                                      ack from server for COMMIT blocks 6-7 => mark 6-7 as clean

Note that the first COMMIT is submitted before receiving all ACKs for
the previous writes, hence the second COMMIT is necessary. It seems
that your patch does not improve the timing at all.

Thanks,
Fengguang
