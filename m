Treating blocks as unused due to content seems a bad idea, if you want them to 
be unused look for references to TRIM, if you want this for security look at 
shred. And if you are interested in backing sparse files I believe that the tar 
"-S" option will do what you want or provide code you can use to start writing 
what you want.

I don't think this is a good solution to the problem that unused space is not 
accounted as you wish it would be. Most filesystems have a bitmap to track this 
already, a handle on that would be more generally useful.

Deleting files is slow enough, identifying unused storage by content is 1950s 
thinking, and also ignores the fact that new drives often don't come zeroed, and 
would behave badly unless you manually zeroed the unused portions.

I doubt this is the optimal solution, since you would have to read the zeros to 
see if they were present, making backup smaller but no faster than just doing a 
copy.
