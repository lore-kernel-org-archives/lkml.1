Seems like a reasonable idea. It represents yet another change to the
userspace API following the 2.6.25.x one, but I guess that again it's
not one that anyone is seriously relying on yet (in particular since
it's not usable more than once from the same parent currently).

You could reduce the patch churn by naming this parameter nodename.

We should probably stop using MAX_CGROUP_TYPE_NAMELEN for this buffer
length and use something that explicitly sized to fit a pid_t.

Maybe pass task_pid(current) here rather than doing the ?: in
ns_cgroup_clone() ?
