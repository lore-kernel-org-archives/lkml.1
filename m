You could add journal to raid5.

AFAICT, you mount block device, not disk. Many block devices fail the
test. And since users (and block device developers) do not  know in
detail how disks behave, it is hard to blame them... ("you may corrupt
sector you are writing to and ext3 handles that ok" was surprise for
me, for example).
