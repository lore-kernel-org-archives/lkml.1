  ftruncate() actually allocates no blocks. It just updates file size (at
least for most filesystems). The hole is created as you write.

  I'm not sure I understand here. Do you mean that we should not decide
about discarding dirty bits depending on whether the buffers have
underlying blocks or not? In my opinion that should be correct option
because from what the man page says, user is not guaranteed what happens
when the file size is extended to 10000 and he tries to write from offset
1024 (old i_size) further... Anyway, I'm not defending doing that :-) I'm
just trying to understand what you mean.

  This is the thing my patches try to achieve :). At truncate time (or
generally just before i_size is extended), we check the last page and
propagate dirty bits to buffers inside old i_size (and clear the ones
beyond old i_size). We also writeprotect the page so that if someone tries
to write to it via mmap in future, we get page fault, page_mkwrite() is
called and a filesystem allocates all blocks it needs with the new i_size.

  Yes, that would be more work. But I never intended to do this...
