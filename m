sysfs_rename_mutex() keeps out renaming and moving not removing.  Also,
reference prevents sysfs_dirent from being released not from being
removed.  The different in lookup path is that it searches the children
list - sd's are unlinked from children list on removal.

The reason why sysfs_get_dentry() climbed up first then climbed down was
not because of performance.  It was to support the original shadow
implementation.  Because there was no reliable way to reach a leaf node
from the root, dentries of all shadows are pinned such that they can
serve as the starting point for dentry lookup and the climing up was to
reach that starting point.  Now that the dentry-multiplexing shadow
support is gone, there's no need to do the climing up.

Yeah, actually the only essential user of that kind of look up is
sysfs_drop_dentry() which is in deletion path and can't fail due to
allocation failure and has the logic open-coded.  I have nothing against
__sysfs_get_dentry().  It was just not needed by the patches I forwarded
this time.  Feel free to include it as you see fit.

I'm currently working on kobj/sysfs separation.  As most internal
implementation is sd based already, the changes are mostly confined to
interface functions but it's still a big change.  I think I'll be able
to post the patches in this week or early next week at the latest.

Thanks.
