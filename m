Thank you James.
I will submit new patch that will throttle (if required) from
eh_timed_out call back.

Regards,

Sumant

OK, this is still not nice.  What you need to be doing is intercepting
the timeout before it fires (and quiesces the machine).  Currently the
eh_timed_out() callback is only exposed to transport classes, I'll put
it back into the host template and then you can use it.
