Okay, that isn't exactly the impression I get but... well.  Let's see.

A few things...

1. The lookup is currently done linearly and is fast enough for now.
Also, most lookup ops are cached by vfs layer.  I'm not sure how
probable it is that we're gonna need hash or tree based sd lookup.

2. I don't think it's gonna be too difficult to speed up bitmap based
lookup.  It would require a bit more intelligence but there's no
fundamental restriction.  Just organizing the tree by tag first would
give us the same order of magnitude lookup given that the tags are used
the same way.

For netns, yes.  I just think it would be better if the sysfs mechanism
to support that concept is more generic especially because it doesn't
seem too difficult to make it that way.

The kobject op seems a bit strange way to interface to me.  For mount,
yeah, we'll need a hook somewhere or pass it via mount option maybe.

Yeah, this really should be something which can't change once it's mounted.

I'm not so sure here.  As a policy, maybe but I don't really see a
fundamental reason that the mechanism should enforce this.

Why not just add a parameter to sysfs_create_dir()?  It's just twisted.

Yes, that's why I view it as strange.  These can be done in forward way
(by passing in mount options and/or arguments) but it's done by first
going into the sysfs and then calling back out to outer layer.

Thanks.
