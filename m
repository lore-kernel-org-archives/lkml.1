Right. And that is what happens in XFS because it purges the
caches on direct I/O and forces data to be re-read from disk.

Effectively, if you are mixing direct I/O with other types of I/O
(buffered or mmap) then the application really needs to be certain
it is doing the right thing because there are races that can occur
below the filesystem. All we care about in the filesystem is that
what we cache is the same as what is on disk, and that implies that
direct I/O needs to purge the cache regardless of the state it is in....

Hence we need to unmap pages and use truncate semantics on them to
ensure they are removed from the page cache....

Cheers,

Dave.
