Subject: [patch 29/47] crypto: move s390 Kconfig options.
Content-Disposition: inline; filename=128-crypto-kconfig.diff
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Jan Glauber <jan.glauber@de.ibm.com>

Move s390 crypto Kconfig options to drivers/crypto/Kconfig to have all
hardware crypto devices in one place.

This also makes messing up the kernel source tree easier for some people.
