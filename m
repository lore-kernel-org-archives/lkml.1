How about something like this. Comments welcome. Should we move this to
a dedicated header file? fs.h is amazingly cluttered as it is.

+ * The below are the various read and write types that we support. Some of
+ * them include behavioral modifiers that send information down to the
+ * block layer and IO scheduler. Terminology:
+ *
+ *	The block layer uses device plugging to defer IO a little bit, in
+ *	the hope that we will see more IO very shortly. This increases
+ *	coalescing of adjacent IO and thus reduces the number of IOs we
+ *	have to send to the device. It also allows for better queuing,
+ *	if the IO isn't mergeable. If the caller is going to be waiting
+ *	for the IO, then he must ensure that the device is unplugged so
+ *	that the IO is dispatched to the driver.
+ *
+ *	All IO is handled async in Linux. This is fine for background
+ *	writes, but for reads or writes that someone waits for completion
+ *	on, we want to notify the block layer and IO scheduler so that they
+ *	know about it. That allows them to make better scheduling
+ *	decisions. So when the below references 'sync' and 'async', it
+ *	is referencing this priority hint.
+ *
+ * With that in mind, the available types are:
+ *
+ * READ			A normal read operation. Device will be plugged.
+ * READ_SYNC		A synchronous read. Device is not plugged, caller can
+ *			immediately wait on this read without caring about
+ *			unplugging.
+ * READA		Used for read-ahead operations. Lower priority, and the
+ *			 block layer could (in theory) choose to ignore this
+ *			request if it runs into resource problems.
+ * WRITE		A normal async write. Device will be plugged.
+ * SWRITE		Like WRITE, but a special case for ll_rw_block() that
+ *			tells it to lock the buffer first. Normally a buffer
+ *			must be locked before doing IO.
+ * WRITE_SYNC_PLUG	Synchronous write. Identical to WRITE, but passes down
+ *			the hint that someone will be waiting on this IO
+ *			shortly.
+ * WRITE_SYNC		Like WRITE_SYNC_PLUG, but also unplugs the device
+ *			immediately after submission. The write equivalent
+ *			of READ_SYNC.
+ * WRITE_ODIRECT	Special case write for O_DIRECT only.
+ * SWRITE_SYNC
+ * SWRITE_SYNC_PLUG	Like WRITE_SYNC/WRITE_SYNC_PLUG, but locks the buffer.
+ *			See SWRITE.
+ * WRITE_BARRIER	Like WRITE, but tells the block layer that all
+ *			previously submitted writes must be safely on storage
+ *			before this one is started. Also guarantees that when
+ *			this write is complete, it itself is also safely on
+ *			storage. Prevents reordering of writes on both sides
+ *			of this IO.
