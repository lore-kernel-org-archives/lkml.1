Yeah, we will find a way to do that.

We want to unify the event handling, if we add AN support proper. That
means that polled device should send similar events as AN capable, and
userspace runs the same code in both cases. The polling for non-AN
devices would be just a periodic open() and the result would not be used
for anything. We would rely on the events triggered by the polling.

Can you try the attached patch, what does it do in your setup, and how
it behaves with AN and without?

Btw, what is the behavior of the eject button on a locked drive with AN.
Today we poll for changes to get notification about the pressed button,
which otherwise would be ignored on a locked drive.

Thanks,
Kay

Subject: scsi: send media state change modification events

This will send for a card reader slot (remove/add media):
  UEVENT[1187091572.155884] change   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb5/5-2/5-2:1.0/host7/target7:0:0/7:0:0:0 (scsi)
  UEVENT[1187091572.162314] remove   /block/sdb/sdb1 (block)
  UEVENT[1187091572.172464] add      /block/sdb/sdb1 (block)
  UEVENT[1187091572.175408] change   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb5/5-2/5-2:1.0/host7/target7:0:0/7:0:0:0 (scsi)

and for a DVD drive (add/eject media):
  UEVENT[1187091590.189159] change   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.1/host4/target4:0:0/4:0:0:0 (scsi)
  UEVENT[1187091590.957124] add      /module/isofs (module)
  UEVENT[1187091604.468207] change   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.1/host4/target4:0:0/4:0:0:0 (scsi)

Userspace gets events, even for unpartitioned media. This unifies
the event handling for asynchronoous events (AN) and events caused by
perodical polling the device from userspace.
