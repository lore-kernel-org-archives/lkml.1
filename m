Unfortunately, it isn't.  The registration step while scanning is at the
end of scsi_add_lun():


	if (!async && scsi_sysfs_add_sdev(sdev) != 0)
		return SCSI_SCAN_NO_RESPONSE;

	return SCSI_SCAN_LUN_PRESENT;

The !async should mean that the addition *only* occurs for the non async
scan case ... if you remove the post async scan add, we'll lose devices.

Could you add some debugging first to see if we're actually adding the
device twice (and also, if we are, what the value of the async is).
