Heh ... I'll make you a deal.  Find just one user of one of these
drivers who can make use of them built in, and I'll apply the patch.  

I'm just a bit reluctant to touch these drivers, since they're all
incredibly ancient.  We don't have good luck with simple transformation
patches on the older drivers ... and it seems to take months before
anyone notices there's a problem.
