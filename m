Hi Andrea and others,

I always had this doubt in mind that any kind of 2nd level controller will
have no idea about underlying IO scheduler queues/semantics. So while it
can implement a particular cgroup policy (max bw like io-throttle or
proportional bw like dm-ioband) but there are high chances that it will
break IO scheduler's semantics in one way or other.

I had already sent out the results for dm-ioband in a separate thread.

http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2009-04/msg07258.html

Here are some basic results with io-throttle. Andrea, please let me know
if you think this is procedural problem. Playing with io-throttle patches
for the first time.

I took V16 of your patches and trying it out with 2.6.30-rc4 with CFQ
scheduler.

I have got one SATA drive with one partition on it.

I am trying to create one cgroup and assignn 8MB/s limit to it and launch
on RT prio 0 task and one BE prio 7 task and see how this 8MB/s is divided
between these tasks. Following are the results.

Following is my test script.

*******************************************************************
#!/bin/bash

mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/sdb

mount -t cgroup -o blockio blockio /cgroup/iot/
mkdir -p /cgroup/iot/test1 /cgroup/iot/test2

# Set bw limit of 8 MB/ps on sdb
echo "/dev/sdb:$((8 * 1024 * 1024)):0:0" >
/cgroup/iot/test1/blockio.bandwidth-max

sync
echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

echo $$ > /cgroup/iot/test1/tasks

# Launch a normal prio reader.
ionice -c 2 -n 7 dd if=/mnt/sdb/zerofile1 of=/dev/zero &
pid1=$!
echo $pid1

# Launch an RT reader  
ionice -c 1 -n 0 dd if=/mnt/sdb/zerofile2 of=/dev/zero &
pid2=$!
echo $pid2

wait $pid2
echo "RT task finished"
**********************************************************************

Test1
=====
Test two readers (one RT class and one BE class) and see how BW is
allocated with-in cgroup

With io-throttle patches
------------------------
- Two readers, first BE prio 7, second RT prio 0

234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 55.8482 s, 4.2 MB/s
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 55.8975 s, 4.2 MB/s
RT task finished

Note: See, there is no difference in the performance of RT or BE task.
Looks like these got throttled equally.


Without io-throttle patches
----------------------------
- Two readers, first BE prio 7, second RT prio 0

234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 2.81801 s, 83.1 MB/s
RT task finished
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 5.28238 s, 44.3 MB/s

Note: Because I can't limit the BW without io-throttle patches, so don't
      worry about increased BW. But the important point is that RT task
      gets much more BW than a BE prio 7 task.

Test2
====
- Test 2 readers (One BE prio 0 and one BE prio 7) and see how BW is
distributed among these.

With io-throttle patches
------------------------
- Two readers, first BE prio 7, second BE prio 0

234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 55.8604 s, 4.2 MB/s
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 55.8918 s, 4.2 MB/s
High prio reader finished

Without io-throttle patches
---------------------------
- Two readers, first BE prio 7, second BE prio 0

234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 4.12074 s, 56.8 MB/s
High prio reader finished
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 5.36023 s, 43.7 MB/s

Note: There is no service differentiation between prio 0 and prio 7 task
      with io-throttle patches.

Test 3
======
- Run the one RT reader and one BE reader in root cgroup without any
  limitations. I guess this should mean unlimited BW and behavior should
  be same as with CFQ without io-throttling patches.

With io-throttle patches
=========================
Ran the test 4 times because I was getting different results in different
runs.

- Two readers, one RT prio 0  other BE prio 7

234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 2.74604 s, 85.3 MB/s
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 5.20995 s, 44.9 MB/s
RT task finished

234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 4.54417 s, 51.5 MB/s
RT task finished
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 5.23396 s, 44.7 MB/s

234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 5.17727 s, 45.2 MB/s
RT task finished
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 5.25894 s, 44.5 MB/s

234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 2.74141 s, 85.4 MB/s
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 5.20536 s, 45.0 MB/s
RT task finished

Note: Out of 4 runs, looks like twice it is complete priority inversion
      and RT task finished after BE task. Rest of the two times, the
      difference between BW of RT and BE task is much less as compared to
      without patches. In fact once it was almost same.

Without io-throttle patches.
===========================
- Two readers, one RT prio 0  other BE prio 7 (4 runs)

234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 2.80988 s, 83.3 MB/s
RT task finished
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 5.28228 s, 44.3 MB/s

234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 2.80659 s, 83.4 MB/s
RT task finished
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 5.27874 s, 44.4 MB/s

234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 2.79601 s, 83.8 MB/s
RT task finished
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 5.2542 s, 44.6 MB/s

234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 2.78764 s, 84.0 MB/s
RT task finished
234179072 bytes (234 MB) copied, 5.26009 s, 44.5 MB/s

Note, How consistent the behavior is without io-throttle patches.

In summary, I think a 2nd level solution can ensure one policy on cgroups but
it will break other semantics/properties of IO scheduler with-in cgroup as
2nd level solution has no idea at run time what is the IO scheduler running
underneath and what kind of properties it has.

Andrea, please try it on your setup and see if you get similar results
on or. Hopefully it is not a configuration or test procedure issue on my
side.

Thanks
Vivek
