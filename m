The hole would only be present on non coherent architectures though. We
also still need the padding after the sense_buffer. But yeah, moving the
sense buffer to first position would diminish the size of the hole I
suppose.

Re-oreder isn't enough. We need both re-order and the __dma_buffer
annotation to ensure proper padding. Some archs have 64 or even 128
bytes cache line size.

I agree that in the long run, a better solution should be done involving
reworking the way the sense buffer is allocated. I started modifying the
EH code to kmalloc it, but it gets very messy with the current interface
between drivers and EH. I still have some patches around I can send,
though some drivers need fixing (error handling on kmalloc failure).
James seem to have a better idea of pre-allocating sense buffers per
host based on how many they can have in flight which I haven't looked
at.

I think that's pretty much was James was proposing indeed.
