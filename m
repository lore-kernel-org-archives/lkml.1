Hi Ryo,

Fairness in terms of size of IO or number of requests is probably not the
best thing to do on rotational media where seek latencies are significant.

It probably should work just well on media with very low seek latencies
like SSD.

So on rotational media, either you will not provide fairness to random 
readers because they are too slow or you will choke the sequential readers
in other group and also bring down the overall disk throughput.

If you don't decide to choke/throttle sequential reader group for the sake
of random reader in other group then you will not have a good control
on random reader latencies. Because now IO scheduler sees the IO from both
sequential reader as well as random reader and sequential readers have not
been throttled. So the dispatch pattern/time slices will again look like..

	SR1 SR2 SR3 SR4 SR5 RR.....

	instead  of

	SR1 RR SR2 RR SR3 RR SR4 RR ....
 
SR --> sequential reader,  RR --> random reader

What was flow control doing?

Even if you maintain separate queues for sync and async, in what ratio will
you dispatch reads and writes to underlying layer once fresh tokens become
available to the group and you decide to unthrottle the group.

Whatever policy you adopt for read and write dispatch, it might not match
with policy of underlying IO scheduler because every IO scheduler seems to
have its own way of determining how reads and writes should be dispatched.

Now somebody might start complaining that my job inside the group is not
getting same reader/writer ratio as it was getting outside the group.

Thanks
Vivek
