That's how I'm currently writing my virtual disk client driver
for the Sun LDOMS stuff, as a block device.

The remaining issues are the partitioning (which we're discussing in
another thread) and how to export the scsi passthru support in such a
non-scsi block driver.

The main disk I/O block read and write is done using descriptors
sent to the disk server.  SCSI pass-through is provided (optionally)
so that disk analysis tools can do things like MODE_SENSE on the
disk.
