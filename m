For faster random I/O:
 * Decrease chunk size
 * Migrate files that have higher random I/O to a RAID1 set, using disks
with the lowest access time/latency
 * If possible, use the /dev/shm file system 
 * Determine I/O size of apps that produce most of the random I/O, and
make sure that md+filesystem matches. If most random I/O is 32KB, then
don't waste bandwidth by making md read 256KB at a time, or making it
read 2x16KB I/Os. Also don't build md sets like 4-drive RAID5, (Do a
5-drive RAID5 set), because non-parity data isn't a multiple of 2. A
10-drive RAID5 set with heavy random I/O is also profoundly wrong
because you are just removing the opportunity to have all of those heads
processing random I/O. 
 * If you only have one partition on a md set, then partition it into a
few file systems. This may provide greater opportunity for caching I/Os.
 * Experiment with different file systems, and optimize accordingly.  
 * Turn of journaling, or at least move journals to RAID1 devices.
 * Add RAM and try to increase buffer cache in attempt to improve cache
hit percentage (this works up to a point)
 * Buy a small SSD and migrate files that get pounded with random I/O to
that device. (Make sure you don't get a flash SSD, but a DRAM based SSD
that satisfies random I/O in nanoseconds instead of millisecs). They are
expensive, but the appropriate device.  This is how companies such as
Google & Ebay manage to get things done. 
The biggest thing to remember about random I/O, is that they are
expensive, so just step back and think about ways to minimize the I/O
requests to disk in the first place, and/or to spread the I/O across
multiple raidsets that can work independently to satisfy your load.  All
suggestions above will not work for everybody. You must understand the
nature of the bottleneck.

Veliciraptors

Thank you for sharing these results. One issue that I consistently see 
with these results is miserable random IO performance. Looking at these 
numbers, even a low-end RAID controller with 128MB of cache will outrun 
md-based RAIDs in random IO benchmarks. In today's world of virtual 
machines, etc, random IO is far more common than sequential IO. What 
can be done with md (or something else) to alleviate this problem?

Sorry to sound like a broken record,  16MiB is not correct.

size=$((num_disks * 4 * 16384 / 1024))
echo "Setting stripe_cache_size to $size MiB for /dev/md3"

...and commit 8b3e6cdc should improve the performance / 
stripe_cache_size ratio.

Thanks for putting this data together.
