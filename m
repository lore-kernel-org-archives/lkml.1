Well, tickless is new and shiny and I doubt anyone has done
much testing with XFS on tickless kernels. Still, if that's a new
config option you set, change it back to what you had for .23 on
that hardware and try again.

If you have a multithreaded application that mixes mmap and
direct I/O, and you have a simultaneous munmap() call and
read() to the same file, you might be able to deadlock access
to that file. However, you'd have to be certifiably insane
to write an application that did this (mix mmap and direct I/O
to the same file at the same time), so I think exposure is
pretty limited.

That's client side direct I/O, which is not what the server
does. Client side direct I/O results in synchronous buffered
I/O on the server, which will thrash your disks pretty hard.
The config option help does warn you about this. ;)

It prevents a single thread deadlock when doing transaction reservation.
i.e. the process of setting up a transaction can require the ilock
to be taken, and hence we have to drop it before and pick it back up
after the transaction reservation.

We hold on to the iolock to prevent the inode from having new I/O
started while we do the transaction reservation, so it's in the
same state after the reservation as it was before....

We have to hold both locks to guarantee exclusive access to the
inode, so once we have the reservation we need to pick the ilocks
back up. The way we do it here does not violate lock ordering at all
(iolock before ilock on a single inode, and ascending inode number
order for multiple inodes), but lockdep is not smart enough to know
that. Hence we need more complex annotations to shut it up.

Cheers,

Dave.
