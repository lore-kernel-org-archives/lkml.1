I am actually on the list, just really, really far behind in the thread ;-)

All of the high end arrays have non-volatile cache (read, on power loss, it is a 
promise that it will get all of your data out to permanent storage). You don't 
need to ask this kind of array to drain the cache. In fact, it might just ignore 
you if you send it that kind of request ;-)

The size of the NV cache can run from a few gigabytes up to hundreds of 
gigabytes, so you really don't want to invoke cache flushes here if you can 
avoid it.

For this class of device, you can get the required in order completion and data 
integrity semantics as long as we send the IO's to the device in the correct order.

I am not really sure that you need this ORDERED_DRAIN for big arrays...
