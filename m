2K IO size on 4K page system workload might not be realistic, but
on architectures that has large page size like powerpc or ia64 , I think
this patch has significant effect(4K or 8K IO size on 16K page size).

Can we reserve updated parts of a page even after dirty page is flushed
to HDD? If so we can get better performance number.

Yes you are right. I think when the file size goes beyond memory size,
performance number would decrease.
