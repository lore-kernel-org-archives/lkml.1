I cleaned up the all the sign warnings in the XFS code because
we mirror the kernel code into userspace for tool building (libxfs)
and that results in lots of sign warnings. I left the kernel
warnings switched on in the XFS makefile so we wouldn't re-introduce
the same problems.

Don't know why this isn't showing up in my build though, because:

CONFIG_FSNOTIFY=y

is set and it is obvious the fsnotify wrappers are passing an
unsigned char * (dentry name) to fsnotify() which takes a const char
* for the file name. There's mismatches like this all over the VFS,
so I'm not going to try to fix them....

The patch below should silence the warnings, though.

Cheers,

Dave.

xfs: turn off sign warnings

Because they cause warnings in static inline functions conditionally
compiled into XFS from the VFS (e.g. fsnotify).
