Well, the softwar raid layer could be improved so that it implements
scrubbing by default (i.e., have the md package install a cron job to
implement a periodict scrub pass automatically).  The MD code could
also regularly check to make sure the hot spare is OK; the other
possibility is that hot spare, which hadn't been used in a long time,
had silently failed.

Yep; the solution is to improve the storage devices.  It is *not* to
encourage people to think RAID is not worth it, or that somehow ext2
is better than ext3 because it runs fsck's all the time at boot up.
That's just crazy talk.
