Zap!

Jeff> why not simply use DIV_ROUND_UP?

Fixed.

Done.


Jeff> Hmm, up until this point you use bi to mean bio_integrity, but
Jeff> now it means blk_integrity.  Confusion will ensue.  ;)

Err, uhm.  There is no bio_integrity.  There's the bio integrity
payload which I always refer to as struct bip *bip.  And struct
blk_integrity which is always bi.  I'm also anal about using bv for
the data bio_vec and iv for the integrity bio_vec.  I can't see any
place where I'm inconsistent.


Jeff> struct blk_integrity_exchg is not yet defined in your patch set,
Jeff> so this will likely break git bisect.

bio-integrity.patch and blk-integrity.patch are artificially split up
to ease the review process.  They are not meant to be separate
changesets.


>> + buf = kzalloc(len, GFP_NOIO | q->bounce_gfp);

Jeff> Does this actually need to be zeroed?

Nope.


>> +void bio_integrity_advance(struct bio *bio, unsigned int
> +void bio_integrity_trim(struct bio *bio, unsigned int offset, unsigned int sectors)

Jeff> The above two loops look pretty much the same to me.  Can you
Jeff> factor that out to a helper?

I've created helpers for marking head and tail of the ivec.
