It would be nice to go back to original order, but its not that
simple with current structure of the code. With Nick's patches
unlock_page() happens in generic_write_end(). journal_stop() 
needs to happen after generic_write_end(). :(

Mingming, can you take a look at the current & proposed order ?
I ran into bunch of races when I tried to change the order for
->writepages() support earlier :(

Thanks,
