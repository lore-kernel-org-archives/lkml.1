  I see. Thanks for explanation.

  I meant this would actually happen over a local filesystem (imagine
something like "hostfs" from UML).

  Fine. So I'll keep UID in the quota netlink protocol with the meaning
"the identity of the user for filesystem operations".

  You know, in fact this contains all the information but it is quite useless
for an ordinary user. The message should be understandable to average desktop
user so it should contain some name rather than UID - but resolving the
"filesystem" UID to some meaningful name is completely different issue
and I'd probably leave that for the moment when the kernel infrastructure
and use cases would be clearer...
