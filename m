Earlier only sysfs leaf nodes held ref to kobject that is also 
only during open/close for regular files and in create/follow/destroy
symlinks.

It does complicate a lot in sysfs code. The code is already quite fragile
considering the races (akpm is facing a couple of them, and which I am 
still working on) from VFS/dentry/inode angle. The previous rework of
sysfs was to make dentries/inodes corresponding to sysfs leaf nodes
reclaimable, i.e. looking at sysfs from VFS angle and IIUC you are 
looking at it from the driver layer to solve races between module/driver-
layer/sysfs, which is a valid purpose.

Following are the few rules in short to take care
1. directory dentries are pinned
2. regular files and symlink dentries are reclaimable
3. sysfs_dirent tree is protected using the parent inode's (ie directory 
   dentry's inode) i_mutex
4. sysfs rename is protected using a semaphore, sysfs_rename_sem also.
5. sysfs_dirent starts with refcount of 1 at the time of creation, refcount
   is incremented/decremented when a dentry is attached or detached. So, the
   refcount at the max can be 2. 
6. symlink creation pins the target kobject, so that the corresponding dentry
   is also pinned and removal releases the kobject.

There were few more additions like sysfs poll and shadow directory support,
for which respective authors can review and I can review the VFS related
changes but please split the patches as you like but one possible way
could be as chunks dealing with changes related to

1. data structure changes
2. creation/removal of directories
3. creation/removal of files
4. creation/removal of symlinks
5. open/read/write/close of a file

As far as testing is considered, doing insmod/rmmod in a tight loop in
parallel with working (find, open/read/writhe/close/ file) on /sys, 
makes a good enough testcase to hit races.
