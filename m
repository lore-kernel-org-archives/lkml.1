 	OK ,  Be funny :-} .  Tho it ain't .  I still think I am correct in 
stating that a "'machine check' would be caused by some near to the CPU hardware 
failure" .  Ie: like physically shoved into the motherboard .  Not a 
indirectly connected device .  Such as a disk drive .

 	Actually it's brand new .  Infant mortallity ?  I at least have a cold 
spare available .  So Yes I am replacing that puppy .  I'll drop it into another 
system & give it the format command & see how much the user bad block table 
grows .  I'll bet I'll get a table full overflow on it .

 	That they did .  scsi & raid .

 	I didn't notice the 18 Minute differance .  Drats .
 	The 'MCE's have been ongoing for sometime .  I have replaced every item 
in the system except the chassis & scsi backplane & power supply(750Watts) .
 	Everything .  MB,cpu,memory,scsi controllers, ...
 	These MCE's only happen when I am trying to build or bonnie++ test the 
md3 .  It consists of (now 7+1spare) 146GB drives in the SuperMicro 
SYS-6035B-8B's backplane attached to a LSI22320 .

> Are you sure the box or the room it is in didn't get excessively hot ?

 	The room before and at the time of the MCE was never over 71F .  Now the 
memory temp might be a tad hot but I've got a small jet engine running in that 
chassis as noisy as it is with fans so I don't see how anything in there could 
be too hot .
 	Temp this time ,  71.2F .  everytime I try that array it MCE's .
 	I have another array in a JBOD box of 14 disks & I have no problems 
with this system as long as I disconnect all the drives in the 8 drive Backplane .
 	I guess I'll just have to do without the extra 143,564,800K of data 
space .
