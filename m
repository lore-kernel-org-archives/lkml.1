Yes and yes.

You can download the benchmark but it is complicated to setup. You can
download it from ftp://ftp.dwd.de/pub/afd/afdbench-2.0.0.tar.bz2 and
you will also need ftp://ftp.dwd.de/pub/afd/development/afd-1.4.0pre1.tar.bz2

Here a short guide how you need to set this up (there is also a SETUP
file in afdbench-2.0.0.tar.bz2):

    - create a new user for example afdbench
    - untar afdbench-2.0.0.tar.bz2 where ever your test filesystem is mounted
      eg /home
    - ln -s /home/afdbench-2.0.0 /home/afdbench
    - ensure that in .bash_profile of user afdbench you have:
         PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
    - login as afdbench
    - Untar afd-1.4.0pre1.tar.bz2
    - cd afd-1.4.0pre1
    - ./configure --prefix=$HOME --enable-ftp_reuse_data_port --enable-passwd_in_msg --enable-expand_path_in_message --enable-compiler-optimizations --enable-with_afdbench_settings --enable-splice_support --enable-sendfile_support
    - make
    - make install-strip
    - In afdbench script change BENCH_PASSWD to whatever you have set the
      password of user afdbench.

If you have problems because you do not have openmotif or lesstif, just use
the configure switch --with-gui=none. Also make sure you have an FTP-server
running, I always used vsftpd. To run the test I just called tiny-bench,
in it you will find how you can start it. You can also run without FTP-server
but I do not know if the problems are reproduceable.

Yes, I will try and redo the test as suggested, it might just take a while
since I just made my testing system operational.

What worries me more is the truncation of files, it makes the filesystem
unusable since you loose data. I hope there will be a solution for this.
