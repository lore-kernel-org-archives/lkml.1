Thanks.

Yes, you're correct. That scenario does seem to have a similar problem.
I'm not quite sure yet how to fix it there yet.

It's easy enough to force a d_revalidate at a higher level. The tricky
bit is what to do when that returns 0 or an error. When I spoke to Al
about this, he suggested returning -ESTALE from the follow_link routine
if that occurs. That would force LOOKUP_REVAL to get set and cause the
whole chain of dentries to be revalidated back up to the root (if
necessary).

That's a little more difficult in the file bind mount case as I don't
see where it calls link_path_walk at all and hence can't really deal
with an ESTALE on a reval properly. I'll need to study this code some
more to see what the right fix is. If you (or anyone) has a suggestion,
I'd love to hear it.
