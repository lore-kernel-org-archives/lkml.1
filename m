... and the value of "diff -p" so it is clear what function is being changed.

Something like the following instead if -EIO and journal abort:

		if (!buffer_uptodate(bh)) {
			set_bit(AS_EIO, &bh->b_page->mapping->flags);
			SetPageError(bh->b_page);
		}

It seems end_buffer_async_write() does this already, but
journal_do_submit_data() uses end_buffer_write_sync() and it does not
do either of those operations.
