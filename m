If someone's keen on really restructuring these things -- in this analogy:

Storage
	Storage Options
		...
		Disk
		Optical
		...
	...

Device Drivers
	...
	Storage Support
		...
		IDE
		PATA
		SATA
		SCSI
		USB
		FW
		...
	...

(sound is an example where both in the menus and the tree everything is kept 
under one top-level sound/ directory, not sound/ and drivers/sound/ as for 
networking -- opinions may vary which one's better I guess).

This is just config menus -- on a source code level, it would also make 
sense at least at some point to introduce "storage/" alongside net/ and 
sound/ and move things around I guess.
