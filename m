Sorry, Nicholas, but it's pretty hard to discuss something with you. 
Your complicated manner to express yourself (this isn't a critic, just 
statement of fact, I'm also pretty much not an ideal in this area) 
requires from your interlocutor a lot of effort to simply understand 
you, but I don't feel that you put comparable effort to understand 
what's written to you.

Let's restart our discussion and do it step by step. At first, some of 
terms you use are pretty confusing for me and, I suspect, many other 
people, as well as some terms I use seem confuse you. So, let's start 
from finding a common terminological ground. It will remove future 
misunderstandings and allow people to easier follow us. Below I'll 
propose some terms. I'll tried to make them as close to the regular 
Linux practice as possible, but if I'm not right somewhere everybody is 
welcome to correct me.

1. Let's use term "SCSI transport" instead of "fabric", which you use. 
This is well corresponding to the regular Linux practice as well as to 
SAM. Particularly, SAM doesn't have the word "fabric" anywhere.

2. Target name - an opaque string passed from target driver to SCSI 
target mid-layer. It contains whatever the target driver would like. For 
example, for iSCSI it can be Target Name, or Target Port Name + Target 
Portal Group Tag in string form. For Fibre Channel it can be WWN of the 
corresponding target port. For parallel SCSI it can be target's 
bus:id:lun numbers in string form. SCSI target mid-layer uses it to 
provide access control.

3. Initiator name - an opaque string passed from target driver to SCSI 
target mid-layer. It contains whatever the target driver would like. For 
example, for iSCSI it can be Initiator Name, or Initiator User Name @ 
Initiator Name in string form, like 
joe@iqn.1996-04.de.suse:01:1661f9ee7b5. For Fibre Channel it can be WWN 
of the corresponding initiator port. For parallel SCSI it can be 
initiator's bus:id:lun numbers in string form. SCSI target mid-layer 
uses it to provide access control.

Next, how access control works in SCST. A target driver registers using 
scst_register() a "target", which is an opaque object, used by target 
mid-layer to group sessions and some other related activities. It can be 
for target port for Fibre Channel or Target Portal, or Target Portal 
Group for iSCSI. During registration the target driver supplies target's 
name (see above its definition). Then, the target driver registers each 
new session using scst_register_session() binding it to the already 
registered target. During registration it provides initiator's name (see 
above it's definition).

The target mid-layer has predefined by administrator a set of ACLs. Each 
ACL contains a list of LUNs and a list of initiator names allowed to be 
bound to this group. There are also special "default" ACLs: one per each 
target (i.e. target name) and one global for targets without default ACL 
defined. In scst_register_session() the target mid-layer goes over all 
ACLs searching for one, containing the initiator name. If such ACL 
found, the session bound to it. If no such ACL found, the target 
mid-layer looks if the corresponding target has default ACL defined. If 
there is such ACL, the session bound to it. Otherwise, it's bound to the 
global default ACL.

Such approach has the following 2 advantages:

1. It's pretty simple to implement

2. It's transport independent. The only duty target drivers have with it 
is to do initiators authentication to be sure that the initiator name 
isn't a fake one. Most transports don't need such authentication. In 
fact, AFAIK, currently in Linux only iSCSI transport supports it. So, in 
this approach most target driver are *completely* free from caring about 
access control, *everything* is done by the mid-layer.

With your approach you push a lot of access control functionality from 
the target mid-layer to target drivers. Particularly:

1. Target driver need to care about user space configuration interface 
and each target driver will have a duplicated code. Is it good with tens 
of target drivers?

2. You need to define and then maintain the corresponding interface 
between target drivers and target mid-layer for access control helpers 
functions, provided by the target mid-layer to target drivers.

 From other side, your approach don't have any advantages over one 
already used by SCST, which I described above.

Next, the PAGE_SIZE limit issue.

What you have implemented is "access allowed only for explicitly 
specified initiators and forbidden for all others". But there is also 
another approach: "access forbidden only for explicitly specified 
initiators and allowed for all others". How about it? In fact, it's a 
lot wider used in practice, than one you've implemented.

Then, if we add the "others are allowed" mode, we need a way to somehow 
show from the kernel to user space a list of such initiators. This list 
can be potentially huge with thousands of entries. Also the target 
mid-layer also needs a way to show all existing sessions with some 
transport independent parameters, like ACL, to which each session bound, 
count of outstanding commands, etc.

Thus, the need to show big lists is unavoidable. We can do it only in 
the following 3 ways. Correct me, if I wrong.

1. Add in configfs ability to display large files. This looks for me as 
a huge piece of work, which can easily take many months to be properly 
done, so I don't think this is an option for us.

2. Add a sysfs hierarchy in which we would be able to create for each 
list entry we want to show a dedicated subdirectory, in with we would 
show all the necessary attributes as one or more files. Like:

/sys/scsi_target/
  `-- target
       `-- sessions
           `-- session1
           |   |-- initiator_name
           |   |-- target_name
           |   |-- acl_name
           |   `-- commands
           |
           `-- session2
           |   |-- initiator_name
           |   |-- target_name
           |   |-- acl_name
           |   `-- commands
           |
           .
           .
           .

In this case we would have 2 /sys hierarchies: one in sysfs and one in 
configfs. It's pretty much bad looking, isn't it?

3. Don't use configfs at all and do everything in sysfs. Actually, I 
don't see any real difference between:

# mkdir -p "$FABRIC/$DEF_IQN/tpgt_1/np/172.16.201.137:3260"

and

# echo "add_target $DEF_IQN 72.16.201.137:3260" 
 >/sys/scsi_target/iscsi/control

as well as between:

# ln -s "$FABRIC/$DEF_IQN/tpgt_1/lun/lun_0" 
"$FABRIC/$DEF_IQN/tpgt_1/acls/$INITIATOR_DEBIAN/lun_0/."

and

# echo "add_lun $DEVICE_NAME" >/sys/scsi_target/acls/$DEF_IQN/control

Next, I haven't started breaking SCST code on one which should go to 
upstream and which shouldn't, because it's already "broken" a lot ago. 
All the /proc interface concentrated in scst_proc.c file and this file 
interacts with SCST core via well defined interface. All other SCST code 
in my opinion should go as is. I don't see what STGT or (sorry) LIO core 
can add to it. It's pretty much well polished.

Finally, I very much dislike your "my upstream iscsi_target_mod" and "my 
upstream work" kind of attitude. This is *our* work, right? Or should I 
stop wasting my time in a discussion with predefined result?
