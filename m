If the upper layers are responsible for providing the utsname, you  
will need to fix up lockd and the NFS server's callback client too, at  
least.

It appears to be used only for RPC's AUTH_SYS credentials.  The  
nodename is used to identify the caller's host.  See RFC 1831,  
Appendix A:

   http://rfclibrary.hosting.com/rfc/rfc1831/rfc1831-16.asp

I'm not terribly familiar with uts namespaces, though.  Can someone  
explain why we need to distinguish between these for AUTH_SYS if the  
caller is on a remote system?

I don't like the idea of an oops in here.  Instead, (for now) it  
should warn and fail to create the client, IMO.
