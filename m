You still need to turn off html email attachments, otherwise your
messages won't be accepted by the mailing lists.  It will be an option
like recipient wants text/plain only or something.

It looks like a standard error handling escalation sequence.  Why is
very hard to tell without the entire kernel log.  Why there wasn't a
recovery is also not clear.

There's not much else I can do.  If you post the entire kernel log, the
fusion people hang out on this list and might see something that
indicates what the problem is.
