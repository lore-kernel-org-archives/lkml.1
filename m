I would vote for the simplest possible model that makes sense.
We need a simple model for admins as well as a simple model
which is easy to implement in as bug free way as possible.  The
trick is not making it too simple because that can cost
performance, but not making it too complicated to implement
reasonably and for admins to be able to figure out.

So, I would vote for "yes" as well.  That will yield an
architecture where we can shutdown systems cleanly and will
be easy to understand when locks for clients exist and when
they do not.

    Thanx...
