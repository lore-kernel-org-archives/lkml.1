In RHEL its set to 10 seconds, so its not totally unreasonable.

Sure, the problem is if we run out of blocks in that reservation window, or
somebody else runs out of blocks in their reservation window, we start trying to
steal blocks from other inodes reservation windows.

The workload is on a box with 32 CPUs and 32GB of ram.  Its running some sort of
kernel compiling stress test, which from what I understand is running a kernel
compile per CPU.  Then on top of that there is a dd running at the same time.

I could probably add some locking in here to help the problem, but I'm worried
about the performance impact that would have.  This is just a crap situation,
since we are quickly exhausting our reservation windows and devovling to just
schlepping through the block bitmaps for free space, and thats where we start to
suck hard.  I can look into it some more and possibly come up with something
else, this just seemed to be the quickest way to fix the problem with affecting
as little people as possible, especially since it's only reproducing on a box
with 32 CPUs and 32GB of RAM.  Thanks,

Josef
