Agree, I think we discussed this many years ago as well. I guess a
request queue grouping with fair arbitration would suffice. If you need
to defer for a device beyond that, a simple BLKPREP_DEFER would just
postpone service until the next round. Probably allow both "skip until
next round", or "defer the entire group, service me again next time
first".
