Um, well that's exactly how it works (modulo the fact that there are
parts of the lifecycle where the ref count is zero, like scanning).  The
problem you're complaining about is that the device ref on the target
may take a long time to release, so we can't key the del event on the
refcount going to zero, which is what we do today.
