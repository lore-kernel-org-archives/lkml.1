  But each attribute is just one number (either 32 or 64 bit) so there's
not much to align. Also each attribute has its netlink header so alignment
is anyway hard to predict. Finally, this is by no means performance
critical - average system using quotas may get say 1 notification per user
per month?

  I don't like sending one structure - by doing that you loose the
flexibility of netlink attributes...

  How does generic netlink support versioning? I have not found this
feature. Looking into Documentation/accounting/taskstats.txt it seems that
taskstats are versioning only the structure taskstats itself but not the
buch of attributes as a whole...

  Yes, but generic netlink itself is such an infrastructure, isn't it? It
is about 70 lines of code to implement notification for quota subsystem so
it's really simple...
