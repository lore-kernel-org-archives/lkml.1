This is essentially the same failure mechanism as before, but without
the timeout-related kernel bug.

There is a communications error during one of the reads.  It takes the
same form in both logs: A transfer receives only 4051 bytes when it
should get 4096.  Don't ask me why that happens; it's some sort of
hardware or firmware failure either in the drive or in your USB host
controller.

The kernel tries to recover, but it looks as though the drive is stuck 
trying to send the remaining bytes.  Resets don't help, so the drive 
is taken off-line.

You _might_ be able to prevent these problems by reducing the drive's 
max_sectors value, say to 128.  See

	http://www.linux-usb.org/FAQ.html#i5

No guarantees, though.
