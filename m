Well, I still don't believe this all to be a great idea but it was sort of 
fun so the attached does largely what you want -- build a list of all data 
partitions.

The heads/sectors fields it for now just gets from the HDIO_GETGEO call. A 
better source would be guessing the values from the partition table itself 
but that _also_ doesn't make too much sense. If you're reconstructing a 
sanitized version of the table anyway, it makes better sense to reconstruct 
it with the values HDIO_GETGEO returns at restoration time.

I kept your suggested format, but in fact, the 64-bit "start" value seems 
not very useful if we're getting the value from a 32-bit field in the old 
partition tables anyway. With that shrunk down to 32-bit again, there would 
be enough room for the complete partition table entry...

Thanks, but real computers won't host my ISA cards...

This should do I guess. It enters all data partitions into the list, in the 
order in which they are encountered and sets a flag to signify that a 
partition was a logical rather than primary. Another option would be to just 
reserve the first 4 entries for the primaries and the rest for the logicals 
but this saves entries if there are fewer than 4 primaries and was in fact 
easier...

The program enters partitions in what should be the same order as Linux 
itself does. Primaries from slot 0 to 3 as normal (but not backed up to 
entry 0 to 3 as said -- the LOGICAL flag indentifies them), extended 
partitions in the MBR in the order as encountered, with the logicals in the 
second-level table as encountered, and following only the first extented in 
the second-level table.

Made it into a generic C program -- didn't look at e2fsprogs sources yet.

Need to be off now and haven't yet stared at this as long as I'd like so 
don't slap me if I've left a few bugs in (although it seems to work nicely). 
The program dumps the backup sector to stdout -- it's ofcourse easy to 
change it to print the entries out so they're easy to compare against, say, 
"fdisk -l -us".

Oh, and once you've looked at it, please throw it away. As said, I still 
don't think it's a great idea ;-)

Rene.
