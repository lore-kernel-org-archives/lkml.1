This is my exact motivation.

Of course, I know about both smartctl and hddtemp tools.

I looked for reliable method of classifying devices. Unfortunately,
without success. Maybe it's better to disable automatic scanning and provide
a user (udev) with ability to enable monitoring on explicitly pointed device.

Unfortunately, every SMART attribute is either reserved or vendor specific
as per T13. AFAIK, 194 is the most popular. That's why I have chosen it
in the first version. However, attribute number (and interpretation method
as well) may become configurable. Moreover, we can use hddtemp database
to initially configure scsitemp. And use unified hwmon interface later :)
