D-Bus? ;-)

On an integrated system like this, do you consider it acceptable to only do 
the MS-DOS partitions and not the other types that may be present _inside_ 
those partitions? (MINIX subpartitions, BSD slices, ...). I believe those 
should really also be done, but this would require keeping more information 
again.

I've cleaned up what I posted yesterday a bit and made it into the type of 
standalone-by-design program you suggest here (the version from yesterday 
required a -DTEST to be so). Not with the blkid bits though. Just dumps the 
sector to stdout (and a textual version to stderr if compiled with -DDEBUG).

I (very) briefly looked at blkid but unless I'm mistaken blkid needs device 
names? The documentation seems to be missing. When scanning the device for 
the partition table, we've built a list of partitions with offsets into the 
device and it would be nice if we could hand the fd and the offset off to 
something directly. If the program has to construct device names itself 
there's another truckload of pitfalls right there.

It wouldn't be hard to log minors as such, but you'd also need to be very 
sure you'd always do this in the same order as the kernel so that what I 
consider to be "/dev/sda2" is the same the kernel considers it to be. This 
is again rather fragile.

It might in fact make sense to just ask the kernel for the partitions on a 
device and not bother with scanning anything ourselves. Ie, just walk sysfs. 
Would you agree? This siginificantly reduces the risk of things getting out 
of sync, both scanning order and implementation.

The kernel doesn't currently store/export everything you'd want to store in 
a backup (as far as I'm aware, that is) but that could conceivably change. 
It would make things significantly less fragile.

Rene.
