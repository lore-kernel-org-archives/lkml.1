Hi Vivek,

sorry for not getting back to you sooner. I think that the short answer
to this question is that the code should be protected by
CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP instead of CONFIG_PROC_VMCORE. This should ensure
that the memory where the elfheader lies is not used by the crashkernel,
regardless of if CONFIG_PROC_VMCORE is in effect or not.

I will make a patch for this ASAP.
