The device-mapper layer doesn't distinguish between the first creation
and every activation there after.  The blk_stack_limits() method is
called by DM when an LV's table is pushed down to the kernel.  As such,
you'll always see the warnings.  Think of it as motivation to fix
libparted and all the other storage tools (LVM2 included) to create
properly aligned devices :)

OK, that is not possible; if you're seeing messages like the following:
device-mapper: table: 254:0: target device sda6 is misaligned

You should definitely have the topology attributes in the associated
device's sysfs tree.  What does the following show on your 2.6.31-rc1
system that produced the above "target device sda6 is misaligned":

find /sys/block/sda/queue -type f

If you don't see attributes like the following you're collecting
information from the wrong machine:

/sys/block/sda/queue/logical_block_size
/sys/block/sda/queue/physical_block_size
/sys/block/sda/queue/minimum_io_size
/sys/block/sda/queue/optimal_io_size
