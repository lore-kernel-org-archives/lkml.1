unless you also freeze the system as a whole (in a 'refrigerator
suspend' way).. the "clean" part is just about a nanosecond long. After
that stuff gets dirty again (you're doing that sendfile to receive more
packets from the FTP upload etc etc).
Sure you can pause those. But there's a real risk that you end up
pausing the app that you want to unfreeze the fs (via the memory
allocation->direct reclaim path). And no, mlock doesn't help.
Especially with delayed allocation, where data writes will cause
metadata activity, this is not just theory.
