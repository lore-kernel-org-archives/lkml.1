I agree, hence I previously wrote and submitted an IDENTICAL patch. I'll
go and test things, not sure why you think that AS and CFQ perform very
differently here, to my knowledge no such postings exist for this test
case. And I'll state again that if they do, of course I'll look into
that and fix it.

One thing that may be of concern is the immediate unplug, but on the
other hand, we do an immediate wait which would unplug anyway. So if we
just look at the sqlite regression, I'm sure it'll be pretty easy to pin
point with some blktrace data.
