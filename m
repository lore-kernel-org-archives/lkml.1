ok.
So, Can I get your Acked-by?

No.

The problem is, get_user_pages() increment page_count only.
but VM page-fault logic don't care page_count. (it only care page::_mapcount)
Then, fork and pagefault can change virtual-physical relationship although
get_user_pages() is called.

drawback worst aio scenario here
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
io_setup() and gup			inc page_count

fork					inc mapcount
					and make write-protect to pte

write ring from userland(*)		page fault and
					COW break.
					parent process get copyed page and
					child get original page owner-ship.

kmap and memcpy from kernel		change child page. (it mean data lost)

(*) Is this happend?

MADV_DONTFORK or down_read(mmap_sem) or down_read(mm_pinned_sem) 
or copy-at-fork mecanism(=Nick/Andrea patch) solve it.
