Hi Jan:
    I feel that the problem you saw is kind of differnt than mine. As
you mentioned that you saw the PageError() message, which i don't see
it on my system. I tried you patch(based on 2.6.21) on my system and
it runs ok for 2 days, Still, since i don't see the same error message
as you saw, i am not convineced this is the root cause at least for
our problem. I am still looking into it.
    So, are you seeing the PageError() every time the problem happened?

--Ying
