hpsa: fix bug in adjust_hpsa_scsi_table which caused devices
which have changed size, etc. to do the wrong thing.

The problem was as follows:

The driver maintains its current idea of what devices are present
in the h->dev[] array.  When it updates this array, it scans the
hardware, and produces a new list of devices, call it sd[], for
scsi devices.

Then, it compares each item in h->dev[] vs. sd[], and any items which
are not present sd it removes from h->dev[], and any items present
in sd[], but different, it modifies in h->dev[].

Then, it looks for items in sd[] which are not present in h->dev[],
and adds those items into h->dev[].  All the while, it keeps track
of what items were added and removed to/from h->dev[].

Finally, it updates the SCSI mid-layer by removing and adding
the same devices it removed and added to/from h->dev[]. (modified
devices count as a remove then add.)

originally, when a "changed" device was discovered, it was
removed then added to h->dev[].  The item was added to the *end*
of h->dev[].  And, the item was removed from sd[] as well
(nulled out).  As it processed h->dev[], these newly added items
at the end of the list were encountered, and sd[] was searched,
but those items were nulled out.  So they ended up getting removed
immediately after they were added.

The solution is to have a way to replace items in the h->dev[]
array instead of doing a remove + add.  Then the "changed" items.
are not encountered a second time, and removed.
