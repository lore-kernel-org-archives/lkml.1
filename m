The transport might also want a say. I see ABORTED COMMAND
errors often enough with SAS (e.g. due to expander congestion)
to warrant at least one retry (which works in my testing).
SATA disks behind SAS infrastructure would also be
susceptible to the same "random" failures.

Transport Layer Retries (TLR) in SAS should remove this class
of transport errors but only SAS tape drives support TLR as
far as I know.
