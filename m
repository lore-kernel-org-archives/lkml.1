What happened was that you inlined the patch and also attached it.  So
when my email client does save-to-file, I get two copies of the same
patch in the one local file.  This causes me problems.

I suggest that you try to inline the patches.  Email yourself a patch,
check that it still applies.  If this ends up being too hard then sure,
use attachments, but please don't also inline the patch.

btw, please prepare patches in `patch -p1' form.  The headers here should have
been

--- a/fs/ext3/super.c
+++ a/fs/ext3/super.c

So the patch will apply with `patch -p1' when run from the root of the
kernel tree.
