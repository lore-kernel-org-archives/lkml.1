I wanted to point out that this, in particular, is utter nonsense. 
Consider a sequence that looks something like this:

if (foo ? bar : imv_cond(var)) {
	blah();
}

An entirely sane transformation of this (as far as gcc is concerned), is 
something like:

	cmpl $0,foo
	je 1f
	cmpl $0,bar
	jmp 2f
1:
#APP
	movb var,%al	/* This is your imv */
#NO_APP
	testb %al,%al
2:
	je 3f
	call blah
3:

Your code would take the movb-testb-je sequence and combine them, then 
we jump into the middle of the new instruction when jumping at 2!

There are only two ways to deal with this - extensive analysis of the 
entire flow of control, or telling the compiler exactly what is 
*actually* going on.  The latter is the preferred way, obviously.
