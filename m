OK, so I don't really understand what the hotplug flag means.

You seem to be setting it unconditionally on most sata HBAs.  If it just
means "bus is hotpluggable", it should be set to 1 at initialisation and
the few non hot plug busses (like SPI) get to reset it.

However, by definition SATA (like SAS) is a hotplug bus ... why isn't it
set for some SATA controllers ... is it because the HBA itself does
something wrong when a hotplug event comes in?
