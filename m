Hello,

Today version of Linus git tree has a problem with resuming of usb devices. My 
trackball is no longer working after resume from ram. It not even seen by lsusb.  Newly
plugged devices are no longer detected (ie. my usb camera) after resume.

Reloading all usb + ohci/ehci modules doesn't fix the problem. I need to reboot entire 
machine (thinkpad z60m).

Log, lines prefixed with plus character are things new in dmesg after resume
