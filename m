No objection to the patch, but what signal was being sent to nfsd when
you saw this? If it's anything but a SIGKILL, then I wonder if we have
a race that we need to deal with. My understanding is that we have nfsd
flip between 2 sigmasks to prevent anything but a SIGKILL from being
delivered while we're handling the local filesystem operation.

>From nfsd():

----------[snip]-----------
                sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &shutdown_mask, NULL);

                /*
                 * Find a socket with data available and call its
                 * recvfrom routine.
                 */
                while ((err = svc_recv(rqstp, 60*60*HZ)) == -EAGAIN)
                        ;
                if (err < 0)
                        break;
                update_thread_usage(atomic_read(&nfsd_busy));
                atomic_inc(&nfsd_busy);

                /* Lock the export hash tables for reading. */
                exp_readlock();

                /* Process request with signals blocked.  */
                sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &allowed_mask, NULL);

                svc_process(rqstp);

----------[snip]-----------

What happens if this catches a SIGINT after the err<0 check, but before
the mask is set to allowed_mask? Does svc_process() then get called with
a signal pending?
