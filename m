Well, the barriers happen like so (even if we actually only do one barrier in 
submit_bh, it turns into two)

write log blocks
flush #1
write commit block
flush #2
write metadata blocks

I'd agree with Ted, there's a fairly small chance of things get reordered 
around flush #1.  flush #2 is likely to have lots of reordering though.  It 
should be easy to create situations where the metadata for a transaction is 
written before the log blocks ever see the disk.

EMC did a ton of automated testing around this when Jens and I did the initial 
barrier implementations, and they were able to trigger corruptions in fsync 
heavy workloads with randomized power offs.  I'll dig up the workload they 
used.
