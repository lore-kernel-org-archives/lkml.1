To be honest, I'm more leaning towards a NACK than an ACK on this one. I
don't support enough NUMA machines to feel strongly enough about it but
unconditionally setting zone_reclaim_mode to 0 on x86-64 just because i7's
might be there seems ill-advised to me and will have other consequences for
existing more traditional x86-64 NUMA machines.
