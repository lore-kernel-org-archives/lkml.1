That has been the nature of an NFS mount path string since it was first
introduced in NFSv2: it refers to the server namespace. People haven't
complained about this previously, so why should we start changing the
meaning of the mount path when we move to NFSv4?

So, what then if I do

	ln -s ../foo /bar/baz/symlink

on the server, then compare

	mount server:/bar/baz /mnt
and
	mount server:/bar/baz/symlink /mnt

Would you argue that those two should produce the same result? My
interpretation would be as follows:

In the first case, the symlink is visible as /mnt/symlink, and so
'cd /mnt/symlink' will take you to the local path '/foo' on the client.

In the second case, I'd be very surprised if the mount code did anything
other than to follow /bar/baz/symlink to remote path /bar/foo, and then
mount that on '/mnt'

If you agree that the above behaviour is correct, then how would you
argue that replacing '/bar/baz/symlink' with an absolute symlink
(i.e. 'ln -sf /bar/foo /bar/baz/symlink') should suddenly cause mount to
do a bind mount?

Again, why? We don't do that today with NFSv2/v3.

How would the server distinguish between a client that is doing a lookup
of a mount path and one that is looking up a normal path?

...as would different behaviour across different versions of NFS.
