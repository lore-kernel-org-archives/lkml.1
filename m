Thanks Andrea. I had been thinking about looking into it from IO
controller perspective so that we can control async IO (buffered writes
also).

Before I dive into patches, two quick things.

- IIRC, last time you had implemented per memory cgroup "dirty_ratio" and
  not "dirty_bytes". Why this change? To begin with either per memcg
  configurable dirty ratio also makes sense? By default it can be the
  global dirty ratio for each cgroup.

- Looks like we will start writeout from memory cgroup once we cross the
  dirty ratio, but still there is no gurantee that we be writting pages
  belonging to cgroup which crossed the dirty ratio and triggered the
  writeout.

  This behavior is not very good at least from IO controller perspective
  where if two dd threads are dirtying memory in two cgroups, then if
  one crosses it dirty ratio, it should perform writeouts of its own pages
  and not other cgroups pages. Otherwise we probably will again introduce
  serialization among two writers and will not see service differentation.

  May be we can modify writeback_inodes_wbc() to check first dirty page
  of the inode. And if it does not belong to same memcg as the task who
  is performing balance_dirty_pages(), then skip that inode.

  This does not handle the problem of shared files where processes from
  two different cgroups are dirtying same file but it will atleast cover
  other cases without introducing too much of complexity?

Thanks
Vivek
