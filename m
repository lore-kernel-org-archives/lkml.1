Chaining of sg_tables is used for drivers with big sg tables --- and 
vmerge counting is used for drivers with small sg tables. So what do they 
have in common?

Summary, what I mean:

* in blk-merge.c, you have 85 lines, that is 16% of the size of the file, 
devoted to counting of hw_segments

* it is only used on two architectures, one already outdated (alpha), the 
other being discontinued (pa-risc). On all the other architectures, 
hw_segments == phys_segments

* it is prone to bugs and hard to maintain, because the same value must be 
calculated in blk-merge.c and in architectural iommu functions --- if the 
value differs, you create too long request, corrupt kernel memory and 
crash (happened on sparc64). Anyone changing blk-merge in the future will 
risk breaking something on the architectures that use BIO_VMERGE_BOUNDARY 
--- and because these architectures are so rare, the bug will go unnoticed 
for long time --- like in the case of sparc64.

* you are just talking how this code is important for performance without 
showing any single proof that it really is (temporarily disable 
hw_segments accounting by defining BIO_VMERGE_BOUNDARY 0 and get the 
numbers).
