Yes sure, I meant unblocked SIG_DFL signals. But SIGKILL can't be
blocked fortunately.

Again, the parent ns can't rely on, say, SIGTERM. It can be missed
if cinit has a handler, we can do nothing in this case. And if it
is blocked, most probably cinit already has a handler, or it will
set it later, say, after exec. Or it can be just ignored.

Great, so perhaps we can ignore the problem for now, and fix it
later if the need arises.

Oleg.
