It looks like a good candidate for WRITE_SYNC_PLUG instead, since it
does more than one buffer submission before waiting. It likely wont mean
a whole lot since we'll usually only have a single buffer on that page,
but for < PAGE_CACHE_SIZE block sizes it could easily make a big
difference (4 ios instead of 1!).

So on the write side, basically we have:

WRITE                   Normal async write.
WRITE_SYNC_PLUG         Sync write, someone will wait on this so don't
                        treat it as background activity. This is a hint
                        to the io schedulers. This one does NOT unplug
                        the queue, either the caller should do it after
                        submission, or he should make sure that the
                        wait_on_* callbacks do it for him.
WRITE_SYNC              Like WRITE_SYNC_PLUG, but causes immediate
                        unplug of the queue after submission. Most
                        uses of this should likely use WRITE_SYNC_PLUG,
                        at least in the normal IO path.
WRITE_ODIRECT           Like WRITE_SYNC, but also passes a hint to the
                        IO scheduler that we should expect more IO.
                        This is similar to how a read is treated in the
                        scheduler, it'll enable anticipation/idling.

Ditto for the SWRITE* variants, which are special hacks for
ll_rw_block() only.

I have killed REQ_UNPLUG, it doesn't make sense to pass the further down
than to __make_request(), so the bio flag is enough.
