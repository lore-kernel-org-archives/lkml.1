 Not usually - that would take multiple hours of verification, roughly 
equivalent to doing a RAID rebuild since you have to read each sector of 
every drive (although you would do this at full speed if the array was 
offline, not throttled like we do with rebuilds).

That is part of the thing that scrubbing can do.

Note that once you find a bad bit of data, it is really useful to be 
able to map that back into a humanly understandable object/repair 
action. For example, map the bad data range back to metadata which would 
translate into a fsck run or a list of impacted files or directories....
