Hey,

Thanks for the pointers on this..  Yeah, I knew it was going away soon,
but needed it for some legacy drivers..:-)

Anyways, I will drop this patch for scsi_execute_async() when I branch
for v2.6.30-rcX and look and updating target_core_mod/pSCSI to one of
the listed methods to get up and running.  From the looks of it however
we might want something slightly better than blk_rq_map_user() for the
kernel space pages attached to struct scatterlist and page_links..

Just FYI, the target_core_mod struct scatterlist memory will be in
struct list_head with struct page for allocated se_cmd_t (received CDB),
so it will be pretty easy from the target_core_mod+subsystem plugin side
side to put something that along the lines of list =>
page-pointers-array translation and blk_rq_map_user() into a new
function..

lio-core-2.6.git/drivers/target/target_core_transport.c is using
include/linux/scatterlist.h macros when interacting with struct
scatterlist allocated for each subsystem plugin (from the linked list
struct page memory)  I will have a look and see what would need to be
down to allow all kinds of sglists with something new..

Thanks for your comments!
