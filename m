OK, I'll do. But people who will miss it, will blame you by pretty bad
words!

Are you sure??

As I already wrote, in SCST sense allocated on-demand only. It is done
for performance reasons, because the sense is needed _very_ rarely and
the buffer for it is quite big, so it's better to save those allocating,
zeroing and CPU cache trashing. The fact that Linux SCSI ML requires
sense buffer preallocation is for me something rather to be fixed.
Pass-through SCST backend is used relatively rarely as well, so it's
better to keep the sense preallocation for it in the separate code path.
Then, if there is the sense preallocation, it doesn't matter to alloc
with it few bytes more.

Is it getting clearer now?

Well, going this way we can go too far.. Like, to assertion that SCSI
HEAD OF QUEUE task attribute is a property of the Linux block layer as well.

Most SCST backends don't deal with senses at all and generate them only
at the latest stage of the commands processing to deliver errors (e.g.,
file read errors) to initiators.

Can you show me a place where the bio bouncing, i.e.
blk_queue_bounce(), does bouncing of misaligned buffers?

I don't see such places. Instead, I see that all users of the block API,
who cares about the alignment (sg, st, sr, etc.), directly or indirectly
take care about it, by, e.g., switching to copying functions, before
calling blk_queue_bounce(). See blk_rq_map_user_iov(), for instance.
This is exactly what I implemented: handling of misaligned buffers on
the layer upper blk_queue_bounce().

Thanks,
Vlad
