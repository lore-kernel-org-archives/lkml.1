It's interesting feature.  I read the journal checksum patch,
it seems to fix the problem addressed by PATCH 3/4.
However, journal checksum feature is optional, so PATCH 3/4
will be needed as long as checksuming feature isn't turned
on always.

I think it depends on the system and administrator.
When we failed to write metadata to the journal, we...

  (a) abort journaling
      - the filesystem can keep a consistent state if the system
        crashed
      - the system will stop because the filesystem becomes read-only
        state (default)
  (b) only do printk()
      - the system can continue to work
      - bad journalled data may break the file system if the system
        crashed

A user who demands high data integrity will choose (a), and
a user who demands high availability will choose (b).
We might want to enable the user to specify the behavior
on error such as the "errors" mount option.

It's interesting.  For example, when a fsync operation is issued,
commit the current transaction, then read the journalled data of
that transaction to check the checksum.  If the bad data is detected,
flush the whole journal.  Aborting the journal will also make sense
because the journal space is errorneous.
