I've been taking the root group as an example, and extending it. The
root group does not reflect the usage of all the tasks in it. (IIRC,
can't seem to find the stats file there now, please correct me if I am
wrong)

For all practical purposes, it is the same as the init_task_group which
is at the parent level.

Not really. That issue would come into play if every task group was
assigned a control group. The task group is not exposed to the outside
world. (That's why its a hidden task group)
