Congratulations on reaching your v1.0.0 release!

I noticed that you included a reference to my presentation at LSF 08' on
your SCST vs. STGT page liked above, and took my description of your
work (you are more than welcome to come and present your own case at LSF
'09) very much out of context.

If you wish to reference my presentation, please at least make the
comparision between LIO-Core+LIO-Target vs. SCST vs. STGT, and NOT JUST
SCST vs. STGT so that the community are large can understand the
differences and technical challenges.  The more in fighting between the
leaders in our community, the less the community benefits.

Many thanks for your most valuable of time,
