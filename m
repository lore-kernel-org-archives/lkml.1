All devices ... scsi_device has to has a target parent before its

Perhaps I haven't made the problem clear enough.  You only want early
del if the host is going away, otherwise the target might be reused and
it can't be if you've called del on it.  So there needs to be an
integration into the host lifecycle in some form.
