This would mean IO completion (clearing PG_writeback) would have to wait
on the inode mutex, which we can't quite do in O_SYNC and O_DIRECT.
But, what I can do is check i_nlink after the ext3_orphan_del call and
put the inode back on the orphan list if it has gone to zero.

How about I take the guarded spinlock when doing the list_add instead?
I'm trying to avoid the superblock lock as much as I can.

My long term plan was to replaced ordered with guarded, but I can rename
this one to guarded if you think it'll make it more clear.

Yeah, I think it keeps the code a little more readable to have it
separate....gcc will inline the thing for us anyway.

Yeah, in this case the guarded IO should protect i_size, and this write
won't really be ordered.  The block could have zeros from 0-1024 if we
crash.

You see something like this:

create(file)
write(file, 100 bytes) # create guarded IO
fsync(file)
write(file, 400 more bytes) # buffer isn't guarded, i_size goes to 500

My main concern was avoiding stale data from the disk after a crash,
zeros from partially written blocks are not as big a problem.  But,
you're right that we can easily avoid this, so I'll update the patch to
do all extending writes as guarded.

But, we still want buffer_datanew to decide when writes that fill holes
should go through data=ordered.

I'd keep it for the common case of filling holes with write(), so then
the code in writepage is gravy.

Hmmm, O_DIRECT is only waiting on the blocks it actually wrote isn't it.
Good point, will fix.
