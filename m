I think the real fix is to avoid clearing uptodate in case of io errors.
For read io errors, the buffer/page should not have been uptodate to
start with, and for write io errors, an error writing back the buffer
does not mean it is somehow no longer the most uptodate copy of the data.

Higher level policy about IO errors (whether to retry, ignore, throw
out the data, etc) would be nice to implement properly too, but that is
not really the job of the low level cache and IO routines.

I proposed some patches a while back but didn't get much interest.
Maybe I should just ask someone to merge them.
