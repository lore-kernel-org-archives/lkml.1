Yet you continue to expend energy complaining about migrating 
block-based filesystems to OSD, a complex, overhead-laden undertaking 
_no one_ has proposed or entertained.

If Seagate were to release a production OSD device, do you really think 
they would prefer a block-based filesystem hacked to work with OSDs?  I 
don't think so.

Existing block filesystems are very much purpose built for sector-based 
storage as implemented on modern storage devices.  No kernel API can 
hand-wave that away.

The whole point of OSDs is to move some of the overhead to the storage 
device, not _add_ to the overhead.

Well, hey, if you wanna expend energy creating a kernel API that 
presents a complex OSD as simple block-based storage, go for it.  AFAICS 
it's just extra overhead and complexity when a new filesystem could do 
the job much better.

And I seriously doubt Linus or anyone else will want to hack up a 
block-based filesystem in this manner.  Better to create a silly "for 
argument's sake" OSD block device, upon which any block-based filesystem 
can be mounted.  (Note I said block device, _not_ filesystem)

No, a generic abstraction is "(b)" in my quoted paragraph.

But it's certainly easy to create an OSD block device client, that 
simulates sector-based storage, if you are motivated in that direction.

But that only makes sense if you want the extra overhead (square peg, 
round hole), which no sane person will want.  Face it, only screwballs 
want to mount ext4 on an OSD.

That's irrelevant, since no one is calling for block-based filesystems 
to be converted to use OSD.

And I can only imagine the push-back, should someone actually propose 
doing so.  Filesystems are very much purpose-built for their storage 
paradigm.
