Well, I disagree, but perhaps I'm just used to it... Plus the patch
actually adds more lines than it deletes, and the resulting code is
larger. I think that's a pretty good hint not to use helpers, at least
for core code. It's more important in drivers, where we want
easy-to-use and understand helpers, since it minimizes bugs in code
written by people who may not be intimate with the block layer etc.

It's not bugs, as soon as you clear ->bio there's no list to begin with.
->biotail is only ever used for back merging checks. If we didn't do
back merging, we would not need to access the tail element ever. I
suspect the reason why the resulting code is larger is exactly because
it's not a 1:1 transition. When we do a back merge, we don't have to
check of ->tail is set. It always is.
