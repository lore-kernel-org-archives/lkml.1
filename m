As I mentioned in the note above, only patches #4 and #7 were new and
thus these needed to be reviewed. Other patches are _not_ replacements
of any of the patches which are already part of -mm and/or in Ted's
patch queue. They were posted again as just "placeholders" so that the
two new patches (#4 & #7) could be reviewed. Sorry for any confusion.

Please let us know what you think of Mingming's suggestion of posting
all the fallocate patches including the ext4 ones as incremental ones
against the -mm.
