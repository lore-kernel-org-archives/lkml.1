Currently it is left on the file system implementation. In ext4, we do
not undo preallocation if some error (say, ENOSPC) is hit. Hence it may
end up with partial (pre)allocation. This is inline with dd and
posix_fallocate, which also do not free the partially allocated space.

I don't think we need to make it default - atleast for filesystems which
have a mechanism to distinguish preallocated blocks from "regular" ones.
In ext4, for example, we will have a way to mark uninitialized extents.
All the preallocated blocks will be part of these uninitialized extents.
And any read on these extents will treat them as a hole, returning
zeroes to user land. Thus any existing data on uninitialized blocks will
not be exposed to the userspace.
