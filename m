We agreed to differ a while ago on your head in the sand, post it to
LKML because everybody follows that list attitude.  Some nice soul will
always (eventually) forward to the correct list, so this practice more
or less works (just not in as timely fashion as actually posting to the
relevant list).

What's hostile about telling you your patch is wrong and pointing you at
the correct one?

Oh good grief, don't come the raw prawn with us!

You're a kernel maintainer, you are expected to know the rules and
follow them.  The very fact that a well known maintainer posts a patch
with a signed-off-by to Andrew and Linus means that it likely gets
applied.  Because of this, maintainers and other people with similarly
trusted positions are expected to go via the lists and subsystems in
part as general courtesy, but also to verify that their patch is
actually valid before it gets applied.

Are you seriously telling us that it required too much investigation on
your part to figure out that something with a compile failure in
drivers/scsi might belong on the scsi list?

Let me tell you exactly what would have happened if that patch had been
applied:  Because the wrong bars were enabled, the device would have
attached but been non-functional.  Likely Emulex would have picked this
up in their -rc1 testing and spent several days trying to trace the
cause in their labs.  Chances are, that, because this type of breakage
is extremely subtle, they wouldn't have noticed the fact that the enable
should have been _mem not _io.  Then they would have raised the issue to
linux-scsi.  It would probably take at least a person week of effort
before anyone finally noticed what the issue was.

If you can't see that your behaviour needs modifying, I suggest you
seriously consider your position.  For all our talk of a nice utopian
democracy of meritocracy in Open Source, we're critically dependent on
the tree gatekeepers to maintain this.  None of us is immune from the
subtle lure of the arrogance of power but it's a corrosive poison and
must be avoided at every turn.  You and I follow more rules and are held
to a higher standard that the average patch submitter because of our
position in the community (not in spite of it).

James
