Not really, that would make it a chicken and egg problem.  The question
was meant to direct attention to the issue of whether we should share
code for PV drivers or not. I think the answer to this one is yes; the
next thing is how to do it.

The one thing I'm not really keen on having is half a dozen totally
different virtual SCSI drivers for our half a dozen virtualisation
solutions.  Apart from the coding waste, each will have new and
different bugs and a much smaller pool of users to find them.

The IBM vscsi operates slightly differently from the way newer PV
drivers may be expected to operate, but the SRP abstraction does look
like a reasonable one for a PV driver.

So the RDMA piece is what I'm not sure about.  For a protocol
abstraction, SRP makes a lot of sense.  For a hypervisor interface, it's
not really clear that RDMA is the best way to go.  In fact, some more
minimal DMA ring implementation seems to be the way most hypervisors are
set up, but it's still possible to run a nice SRP abstraction over them.

The other piece of this is that it's not clear that SCSI is actually the
best layer for this abstration.  For a simple, fast storage interface,
nbd is probably the easiest abstraction to do (the disadvantage being
the lack of ioctl support, so it really only does storage).
