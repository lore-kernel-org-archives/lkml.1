As of today our inquiry data doesn't neccesarily match the SCSI-3 spec. But that can be changed.

I've had discussions with our partners. They are open to the concept of porting to SCSI. There will be some period of time where there are 2 drivers, however. And as James stated  the udev rules can create the /dev/cciss links so hopefully there will be minimal impact to users.

You're probably right here, also.

Very good. I don't believe most people would have taken the utils into consideration.

Correct.

I'm afraid I have to agree with you. I've been a steadfast opponent of a SCSI port but in the long run perhaps it is the best thing to do.

We'll post something sooner rather than later. I've been hesitant to submit unfinished work but I guess having the community provide input along the way is the best way to go.

OK, Tomo, you win!   :)
