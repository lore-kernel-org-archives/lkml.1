Will fix.

Seems like I also need to update the doc on Kconfig as well.  Do you
prefer this in separate patches? (current patch, kconfig patch, ext4
doc update patch?

I think I did, but honestly don't remember.  Will check with the new
patch. :)

OK.

I don't think it is worth pursuing this feature since this seems to
have been broken for a while now (its been there since the first git
revission in ext3) and nobody has noticed it until now.  It could be
address on a later patch though, since the initial purpose of the patch
was to fix the broken JBD2_DEBUG option. Of course, this may not be
clearly express in the changelog. :)
