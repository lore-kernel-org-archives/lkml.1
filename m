That was in the initial version, before my patch, yes. I dealt with page
crossing at first, then added a more restrictive test to "play safe" (I
should have removed the page-crossing code at that point), but later on
noticed that there was a single case where it's valid to do non-atomic
updates, and it's when the execution flow is bypassed by a breakpoint
(as the immediate values are doing), so the last patch you have removes
the restrictive test and lets the page-crossing code in place.

hrm, I am not convinced it's safe to call vmap() very early at boot
time. In the immediate values implementation, I do call text_poke very
very early at boot to populate the initial values. Or maybe are you
proposing something different from what I currently understand ?
