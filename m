Please don't explain any more, I'm confused enough already. I can't make 
those numbers match 16G no matter how I add them, either the contents of 
the column labeled "size:chunk size" isn't the size of the chunk, or you 
have a multiplier floating around that I don't see.  And you eliminated 
the degraded performance, since your stripe_cache_size is less than 
(raid5 chunk size)*(#disks), I would expect the reads in degraded mode 
to be dog slow because the don't fit in cache, even if 1024k is what I 
call chunk size and certainly not if chunk size is 16G.
