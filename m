Ingo, why do you keep harping this issue? I thought I suggested we agree
to disagree on this and let it rest.

And I would say that, yes, that is a regression, if that config option
is a core option that people are likely to enable. The CONFIG_NO_HZ is a
new option, people will select it. Your example pertain more to the 'use
mmio for IO operations' type options for drivers. If you enable that and
your driver suddenly stops working, you have a clear idea of WHY it
stops working and how to fix it. Not so with this blktrace scenario, I
bet that would take people quite a while to figure out how it broke.

Can we drop this subject now, please? The issue is resolved (and
merged), debating definitions of regressions is not very productive :-)
