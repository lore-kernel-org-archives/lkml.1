  Yes, but that should happen only if start running of blocks (all the free
blocks are reserved). We scan all the groups and try to establish a
reservation window in each of them... Hmm, looking into the code, we also
skip groups with less than window_size/2 blocks free. But that should be at
most 2MB so it shouldn't be a big deal.  How big is the filesystem and how full
does it get?
  BTW: You write above you can see the problem on ext2/3. Can you really
observe it on ext2? I ask because on ext3, the pressure for free blocks is
much higher in stress tests which create & remove files since the space of
removed files can be used only after a transaction with delete is
committed.
  Also have you verified that we indeed take the 'repeat' loop in
ext2_try_to_allocate() often (that's when we race with other threads
allocating blocks)?

  And the kernel compile is single-threaded? My question should probably be
- roughly how many parallel writers are there?

  Yeah, I don't like the locking too much either. I'd first like to
understand what exactly happens on your box. One low-cost thing we could
try is that we won't scan groups for free blocks starting with group 0 but
starting with some random group and wrapping around, like we do it when
searching for free inodes. That should spread writers a bit.

  Well, that's not a small machine but not particularly huge either so I
think we should cope reasonably with it.
