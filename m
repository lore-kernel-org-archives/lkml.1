    [XFS] Prevent ENOSPC from aborting transactions that need to succeed

    During delayed allocation extent conversion or unwritten extent
    conversion, we need to reserve some blocks for transactions reservations.
    We need to reserve these blocks in case a btree split occurs and we need
    to allocate some blocks.

------

IOWs, XFS didn't provide this guarantee until about a month ago....

Well, the above phrasing is taken directly from the posix_fallocate() man
page, and it is intended that sys_fallocate() is used to implement
posix_fallocate(). In that case, the semantics we have to provide are
"writes are guaranteed not to fail due to lack of disk space".

Cheers,

Dave.
