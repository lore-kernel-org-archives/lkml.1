Fixed, thanks. V2 of the patch is coming.

Correct will be something like:

saddr = kmap_atomic(src_page + (src_offs >> PAGE_SHIFT), s_km_type) + (src_offs & ~PAGE_MASK);

I fixed it together with a bunch of similar issues I found reviewing the code
after your comments.

Maybe, but I like the "extra" parens (BTW, in many languages they are required, not
extra), because they give for eyes "points of stop" during reading and, so,
make overlooking various errors much harder.

I've not found anything about it.

I prefer having for variables the visibility scope as small as possible, hence
the style.
