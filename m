Thanks for the insults, and high credit ;)

Yes it's "kinda example (reference) file system" of a pNFS-objects
file system. What can I do life is tough.

So you are the one that starts to invent the wheel here. I thought I was
the one that does that, only you only called me by names, because you never showed
me where.

But please only answer one question for me: Please don't write back if you do not
answer this question:

Why do other filesystems allow to use bios? are they going to stop? Who is going
to remove that?

And as I said, I am going to remove it for now, please be patient. You have never
herd from me that I refuse to do it, did you?
