It's not that bad. Of the file systems which actually fill it in...

For NTFS it's the volume serial number.

For ext[234] it's the UUID xor-folded into 64 bits.
For btrfs the same, but with the root object ID xor'd in too.

For bfs and xfs it's the block device -- which isn't ideal, as Andreas
points out, but is what we'd fall back to anyway.

BFS seems to have a s_volume field which perhaps we could use, but we
should check for it being all spaces and leave f_fsid as zero in that
case. Presumably XFS could be using sb_uuid?

For efs, it'll be either EFS_MAGIC or EFS_NEWMAGIC, which is probably a
bad thing if you want to export multiple EFS file systems. I'll send a
patch to fix that (by leaving it zero) shortly.
