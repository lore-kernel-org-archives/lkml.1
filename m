Actually, I don't think so.  We have precedent for this in the transport
classes: if a device doesn't support a feature, we don't export the flag
for that feature through sysfs.  This allows not only feature control,
but an immediate view of the device capabilities simply by viewing the
sysfs directory.

I think this functionality is very easy to layer in, so there's no
reason not to do it.

Assuming gregkh or kay ack, it won't be.
