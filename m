Hi all,

These are new releases of dm-ioband and blkio-cgroup. The major change
of these releases is that dm-ioband handles sync/async IO requests
separately and it solves write-startve-read issue pointed out by Vivek.
Thank you Vivek for your pointing out the issue.

  Subject: ioband: Writer starves reader even without competitors
  http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/9/15/478

Here is the test result. I did the same test as Vivek did, it reads
32MB files four times during a bufferd writer is running.

dm-ioband v1.14.0
file #   1, plain reading it took: 0.73 seconds
file #   2, plain reading it took: 0.78 seconds
file #   3, plain reading it took: 0.78 seconds
file #   4, plain reading it took: 0.94 seconds

dm-ioband v1.13.0
file #   1, plain reading it took: 14.27 seconds
file #   2, plain reading it took: 22.17 seconds
file #   3, plain reading it took: 12.31 seconds
file #   4, plain reading it took: 17.69 seconds

The summary of the changes are below:
dm-ioband v1.14.0
  - Handle sync/async IO requests separetely, it solves write-starve-read
    issue.
  - Allow it to compile against 2.6.32-rc1.
blkio-cgroup v13
  - Fix style issues caught by checkpatch.pl.
  - Allow it to compile against 2.6.32-rc1.

About dm-ioband
  dm-ioband is an I/O bandwidth controller implemented as a
  device-mapper driver and can control bandwidth on per partition, per
  user, per process, per virtual machine (such as KVM or Xen) basis.

About blkio-cgruop
  blkio-cgroup is a block I/O tracking mechanism implemented on the
  cgroup memory subsystem. Using this feature the owners of any type
  of I/O can be determined. This allows dm-ioband to control block I/O
  bandwidth even when it is accepting delayed write requests.
  dm-ioband can find the cgroup of each request. It is also for
  possible that others working on I/O bandwidth throttling to use this
  functionality to control asynchronous I/O with a little enhancement.

Please visit our website, the patches and more information are available.

I'd like to get some feedbacks from the list. Any comments are
appreciated.

Thanks,
Ryo Tsuruta
