Hi Balbir,

Mini summit is still few months away. I think a better idea would be to
try to thrash out the details here on lkml and try to reach to some
conclusion.

Its a complicated problem and there are no simple and easy answers. If we
can't reach a conclusion here, I am skeptical that mini summit will serve
that purpose.

Thanks
Vivek
