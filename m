How about this ?

commit 174d555d8effb480a23d5dea8db698d1bc2cfa7d
Author: Aneesh Kumar K.V <aneesh.kumar@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

    ext4: call ext4_page_mkwrite even for MappedToDisk pages
    
    We can have pages that are fully mapped to disk. The
    mappedtodisk flag is used to indicate that every
    buffer_head in the page have a mapping block allocated
    on disk. But that doesn't gurantee that we have initialized
    those buffer_head and added it to page via page->private.
    This causes writepage to go BUGON when it find a page
    that have NULL page->private.
    
    The fix is to make sure we initialize the buffer_head and add
    it to page when we are going to write to the page. This can
    be done via ext4_page_mkwrite
