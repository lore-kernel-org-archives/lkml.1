sglist is a low-level I/O representation for device drivers. SCSI
midlayer should not care about sglist. We should not fix SCSI midlayer
for rq->data_len != sum(sg) change (so I can't agree with your
diagrams in another mail).

When if we change a rule, we need to fix something.

If we keep rq->data_len == sum(sg), we need to fix the device
application layer. If we keep rq->data_len == the true data length, we
need to fix the low-level drivers.

Now I'm fine with the commit e97a294ef6938512b655b1abf17656cf2b26f709
since we are in -rc stages. But I plan to send a patch to revert it
and fix this issue in the block layer. I'd like to test it in -mm for
a while.

Only sglist stuff in SCSI midlayer is scsi_req_map_sg now. As you
know, we really want to remove it.

Most of users of request structure care about only the real data
length, don't care about padding and drain length. Why do they bother
to use a helper function to get the real data length?
