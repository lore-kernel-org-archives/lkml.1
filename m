+400 lines of code to avoid much fewer lines of generic code impact 
on the lib/swiotlb.c side sounds like a bad technical choice to me. 

It makes the swiotlb code less useful and basically forks a random 
implementation of it in drivers/pci/xen-iommu.c.

Fujita-san, can you think of a solution that avoids the whole-sale 
copying of hundreds of lines of code?
