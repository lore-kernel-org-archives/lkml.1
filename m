That's what it was for.

No.

The point is:

It seems this driver was once maintained for both 2.4 and 2.6 in one 
file.

As long as this is done, such version checks are OK.

But if a driver is no longer actually maintained for both kernels these 
checks become useless (and there quickly arised unconditional 2.6-only 
code in such a driver) and can be removed.
