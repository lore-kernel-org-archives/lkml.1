Funny, I was working on forward-porting my patches this morning.

Seems fine.

I think we're going to need to figure out whether we should be sending
UNMAP or WRITE SAME ... probably need to dive back into the T10 poostorm
to see what's going on.

Jens had some objections to the block layer bits last time I posted
these.  I forget what they were now (this would have been around May
2nd, I think).  What I've done instead in my current patchset (which
undoubtedly has bugs because it isn't tested, because I'm not supposed
to be working on the weekends) is to make sd_prep_fn() call a new method
in the scsi_host_template.  That should translate the discard request
into a BLOCK_PC ATA_16 command, and we'll all be happy.

It goes a little something like this:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/willy/ssd.git;a=shortlog;h=trim-20090829

Right now, the test tool is telling me 'Operation not supported', and
I haven't tried to figure out why yet.
