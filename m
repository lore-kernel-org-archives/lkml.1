I think from reading my original email and the list of patches it is
quite obvious to the people involved what are the major pieces of
functionality available in TCM v3.2 that people actually *want* and
*care* about that is not available in the existing STGT framework.

I am not sure why you think you need hardware target drivers to prove
that a target engine is generic..?  Why don't you look at the TCM v3.2
code (like everyone else is doing) and see for yourself..?

There are other subsystems (Linux/Net and SCTP for example) that use
procfs for read-only MIBs statistics, so TCM actually having an
implementation of SCSI MIBs available (no other target projects have
SCSI MIBs btw) under procfs is hardly a show-stopper considering the
*entire* control path for TCM v3.2 is using upstream configfs code
anyways.
