Could be viewed as a scsi deficiency at least.  Is it unheard of for
"independent" queues to have shared resources?  If so, then yeah, perhaps
some driver-private locking as James suggested is appropriate.  But if
other drivers face similar problems then perhaps it is something which scsi
core should offer support for.

But whatever.  The situation is that Ed suggested a fix eight months ago,
James suggested enhancements and afaict nobody did anything more, and
machines which use this driver are still crashing.

<checks>

OK, Ed's email client breaks message threading, so you need to hyperjump to
a "different" thread a few days later, in which Ed points out that qla4xxx
also has a shared tag queue.

Ed's email client proceeds to splatter the discussion all over the Jan 2007
archive.  Ed finds a possible bug in qla4xxx.  Jens proposes a block patch.
Ed disagrees, Jeff agrees with Ed, discussion dies, driver still
crashing..

Here's Ed's patch again.  As a suboptimal driver is better than a crashing
one, perhaps we should merge it until we can sort out something better?



From: "Ed Lin" <ed.lin@promise.com>

The block layer uses lock to protect request queue.  Every scsi device has
a unique request queue, and queue lock is the default lock in struct
request_queue.  This is good for normal cases.  But for a host with shared
queue tag (e.g.  stex controllers), a queue lock per device means the
shared queue tag is not protected when multiple devices are accessed at a
same time.  This patch is a simple fix for this situation by introducing a
host queue lock to protect shared queue tag.  Without this patch we will
see various kernel panics (including the BUG() and kernel errors in
blk_queue_start_tag and blk_queue_end_tag of ll_rw_blk.c) when accessing
another in smp kernels).
