Good question.  Latest I had heard was that at least one array vendor
prefers the WRITE SAME.  To me it looks like the much saner interface
for the OS, so unless there are arrays that strongly prefer UNMAP or
we need to make use of the multiple extends feature in it I'd go with
WRITE SAME as first choice.

Queue flag and handling the discard in the prep function is much better
than the prepare function, yes.  I don't like the prep_fn callout to the
host a lot.  If we go with WRITE SAME as prefered discard option for
scsi translating it to TRIM should be relatively easy, it uses the same
LBA/length encoding as the regular WRITE_16, except that the payload is
just a single sector.  That should be not too hard to implement in the
SAT layer.
