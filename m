Ah, OK.
I thought that reporting a (maybe) wrong difference in map/unmap would
be better that a definitely wrong message "freed not allocated
memory". And if the fuzzy matcher would warn about the fuzzy match, a
developer would know that this difference might be wrong.

OK, it just looked like the code did something else the comment said.

Yes, I just read pci-gart_64.c to see if there is a better key.
The API always seems to include size and direction too.

Would it work to to use all device, address, size and direction as
key, as the proposes exact matcher does?
This would obvious not work with the current diagnostics in
check_unmap, as not even single near matches would be returned.
But if you would move the diagnostics from check_unmap into
hash_bucket_find it could work:
If hash_bucket_find does not find a perfect match, it could output:
* no match -> tries to free DMA memory it has not allocated
* 1 match -> warn about any differences (size, type, cpu-address, sg
list count, direction)
* 2+ matches, with perfect match -> no warning; set flag in other matches.
* 2+ matches, without perfect match -> list differences from all
matches; set flag in other matches after returning the best

If differences from a flagged match are output, add a note, that this
warning is unreliable because of these possible map/unmap mismatches.

No, the original report was with a correctly working driver that just
confused the dma-debugging code into issuing wrong warnings:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=124336530609750&w=2

This constructed case was just me trying to find more evil cases that
are currently not covered.

Your patch would blame the correctly programmed second unmap for
"freeing unallocated memory",
my proposal would blame it for the size difference, but with a note
that there was a concurrent second map at the same address.

And in a case where the code maps the same address twice but wants to
unmap it wrong, it would correctly output both possible, but
mismatching maps, instead of the wrong "unallocated memory" warning.

Should it then be added to the fuzzy matcher?
Otherwise I would except the warnings like "DMA-API: device driver
frees DMA sg list with different entry count [map count=2] [unmap
count=1]" to still trigger. (I didn't have the time to test your patch
yet)
