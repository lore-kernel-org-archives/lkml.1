Seems like a good next step...

It's a rather full 1.2Tb raid6 array - can't reformat it - sorry :)
I only noticed the problem when I umounted the fs during tests to prevent 
corruption - and it worked. I'm doing a sync each time it hibernates (see below) 
and a couple of paranoia xfs_repairs haven't shown any problems.

I do have another xfs filesystem on /dev/hdb2 (mentioned when I noticed the 
md/XFS correlation). It doesn't seem to have/cause any problems.

Yes, I'm happy to try these tests.
nb, the hibernate script is:
ethtool -s eth0 wol g
sync
echo platform > /sys/power/disk
echo disk > /sys/power/state

So there has always been a sync before any hibernate.

Nb the screen looks like this:
http://www.dgreaves.com/pub/2.6.21-rc4-ptched-suspend-failure.jpg
whether it hangs on suspend or resume.

So I wouldn't say it *is* XFS at fault - but there certainly seems to be an 
interaction...
At least it's easily reproducible :) Shame about the sysrq

I can think of other permutations of freeze/ro/writing tests but I'm just 
thrashing really. Happy for you to tell me what to try next ...
