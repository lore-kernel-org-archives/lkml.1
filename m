Well, I thought the problem was something like this:

If /dev/pts/1 is the controlling terminal and there are multiple mounts
of devpts, when we open /dev/tty, kernel would somehow have to find the
right instance of devpts.

When init_dev() calls devpts_get_tty(), it would need to specify the devpts
instance. So tty_open() of "/dev/tty" would somehow have to find it based on
the /dev/tty inode (which could be in ext3).

(I thought the issue was similar with /dev/ptmx, ptmx allocates a new
index, /dev/tty accesses an existing index, but both need to somehow
find the right pts instance -no ?)

| /dev/tty and /dev/ptmx already primarily operate by identifying a device
