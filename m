In quotes, because I argued further on that, although my patchset
takes a stand on both issues, it can be easily reverted _within_
that patchset. Moreover, I argue that they can co-exist.

In such situation the kernel will do a bad job if the user is asking
for a bad job. Just like checkpointing without snapshotting the
file system and expecting it to always work.

But if the user is a bit more careful (and even then, not that much),
she can enjoy the wonderful benefits of c/r without the wonderful
benefits of containers.

If useful, it's easy to pass a flag to checkpoint() that will ask
to enforce, say, shared memory "leaks" but not nsproxy or file "leaks".

In fact, even shared memory "leaks" may be useful for some users (e.g.
what the guys from kerlabs pointed out).

Lol .. and disagreement persists among us :)

And indeed, I have heard and seen already a few opinions in favor
of permitting non-container checkpoint. From potential users (not
c/r people).

Yes.

I beg to differ: there is marginal price to support both -- in fact,
enforcing the container requirement (e.g. leaks detection - which,
btw, is imperfect and cannot be made race-free) *adds* code over
the non-container case. So in a sense, we get the no-container case
for free.
