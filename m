Not accurately as it will be including the time spent in CFQ queues as
well as dispatch queue. I will not worry much about dispatch queue time
but time spent CFQ queues can be significant.

This is assuming that you are using token based scheme and will be
dispatching requests from multiple groups at the same time.

But if you figure out a way that you dispatch requests from one group only
at one time and wait for all requests to finish and then let next group
go, then above can work fairly accurately. In that case it will become
like CFQ with the only difference that effectively we have one queue per
group instread of per process.

This probably can be done. So this is like syncing between lower layers
and higher layers about when do we start idling and when do we stop it and
both the layers should be in sync.

This is something my common layer approach does. Becuase it is so close to
IO scheuler, I can do it relatively easily.

One probably can create interfaces to even propogate this information up.
But this all will probably come into the picture only if we don't use
token based schemes and come up with something where at one point of time
dispatch are from one group only.

I can understand that if lesser the seek cost game starts changing and
probably a size based policy also work decently.

In that case at some point of time probably CFQ will also need to support
another mode/policy where fairness is provided in terms of size of IO, if
it detects a SSD with hardware queuing. Currently it seem to be disabling
the idling in that case. But this is not very good from fairness point of
view. I guess if CFQ wants to provide fairness in such cases, it needs to
dynamically change the shape and start thinking in terms of size of IO.

So far my testing has been very limited to hard disks connected to my
computer. I will do some testing on high end enterprise storage and see
how much do seek matter and how well both the implementations work.

Ok, so if both the readers and writers are buffered and some tokens become
available then these tokens will be divided half and half between readers
or writer queues?

Interesting. Actually not blocking kernel threads on per group limit
and instead blocking it only on per device limts sounds like a good idea.

I can also do something similar and that will take away the need of
exporting per group congestion interface to higher layers and reduce
complexity. If some kernel thread does not want to block, these will
continue to use existing per device/bdi congestion interface.
