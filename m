Yes, no errors.

No. The Problem occured sometimes shortly after boot (Once even before X wa=
s=20
up) sometimes only after days of full usage.
Boot starts postgres, thats the only thing that propably always ran. But I=
=20
have seen it while postgres was idle - i.e. just some polls and stats.

Its not a single file, but the whole filesystem, having problems.

Sure, no problem.
At least if the patch is not expensive during run time. The system produces=
=20
test-data for testing our development software and I cant take it down for =
too=20
long.
Thats the reason why I can use something like ext4 on such a system at all =
;-)

It sometimes takes quite a while to reproduce the problem though. The syste=
m=20
ran stable for 4 days so far.
Same kernel as the last time the error occured though.

Any specific debug options I should enable?

Andres
