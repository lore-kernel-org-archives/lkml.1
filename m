Gaah. This interacted with the VFS stuff (the do_filp_open() cleanip in 
particular) I merged from Al earlier today. 

It really looked very trivial, so I fixed it up. Al had split up 
do_filp_open() into several helper functions, and one of your changes was 
to the old pre-split one. I felt confident enough about it that I just did 
the obvious merge resolution, but you guys should check it out to be sure.
