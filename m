Well, for multiple cards that's effectively true with or without async
scanning ... the kernel doesn't know how you've enabled the bios scans
on the cards, so it takes first bus discovery order, so your boot drive
can always end up as /dev/sdb etc.

In theory, async probing shouldn't be racy, but we've likely got a
problem between async SCSI scanning and async sd driver attachment, so
when those are sorted out it should be no worse with than without.
