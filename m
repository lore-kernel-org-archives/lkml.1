The other thing that worries me about it is that the scheme relies
entirely on using the page dirtying mechanism to track updated parts of
a page. You will lose that information as soon as the page cache is
flushed to disk.
IOW: I would expect those numbers to change greatly if you increase the
file size to the point where the VM starts evicting the pages.

There are plenty of ways in which one can tune the performance of NFS.
It all depends on the application. For instance, our lack of tracking of
holes means that we tend to perform very poorly when dealing with reads
of sparse files such as in the above test. Perhaps that might be
considered as an alternative idea?
