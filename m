I'm not sure if the drain buffer is used like that. But is there
easier ways to see the same buffer; e.g. sending the same buffer twice
with DIO?

As I wrote, I assume that he uses GART IOMMU; it allocates an unique
dma address per dma mapping operation.

However, dma-debug is broken wrt this, I guess.
