The generic target mode storage engine discussion quickly goes to
transport specific scenarios.  With so much interest in the SCSI
transports, in particuarly iSCSI, there are lots of devs, users, and
vendors who would like to see Linux improve in this respect.

Having the non SCSI target mode transports use the same data IO path as
the SCSI ones to SCSI, BIO, and FILE subsystems is something that can
easily be agreed on.  Also having to emulate the non SCSI control paths
in a non generic matter to a target mode engine has to suck (I don't
know what AoE does for that now, considering that this is going down to
libata or real SCSI hardware in some cases.  There are some of the more
arcane task management functionality in SCSI (ACA anyone?) that even
generic SCSI target mode engines do not use, and only seem to make
endlessly complex implement and emulate.

But aside from those very SCSI hardware specific cases, having a generic
method to use something like ABORT_TASK or LUN_RESET for a target mode
engine (along with the data path to all of the subsystems) would be
beneficial for any fabric.

Well, having no obvious preconception (well, aside from the email
address), I am of the mindset than the iSCSI people are the LEAST crazy
said crazy SCSI people.  Some people (usually least crazy iSCSI
standards folks) say that FCoE people are crazy.  Being one of the iSCSI
people I am kinda obligated to agree, but the technical points are
really solid, and have been so for over a decade.  They are listed here
for those who are interested:

Thanks for putting this into an historical perspective.  Also it is
interesting to note that the iSCSI spec (RFC-3720) was ratified in April
2004, so it will be going on 4 years soon, which pre-RFC products first
going out in 2001 (yikes!).  In my experience, the iSCSI interopt
amongst implementations (espically between different OSes) has been
stable since about late 2004, early 2005, with interopt between OS SCSI
subsystems (espically talking to non SCSI hardware) being the slower of
the two.
