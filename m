I moved the fallocate patches to the very end of the series in the quilt
tree.  This way the patches will be in the quilt tree for testing, but
Ted can easily leave them out of the git tree so you and Linus won't
pull them with the ext4 patches.

Fortunately, the ext4-specific fallocate patches don't conflict with the
other patches in the queue, so they can (at least for now) be handled
independently in the -mm tree.
