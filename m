Are you commenting on the remove of tail_only, or the reuse of
->new_sg_table.sgl instead of ->saved_sg. The later makes tons of sense
to me.

if you want to keep the "tail_only" and not hack with nents && orig_nents
that's fine.

No! you miss-understood. blk_queue_bounce() does all the bouncing,
high-mem, alignment, padding, draining, all of them.

The code you took from Tejun was meant to go at the bio level. Here
you are already taken care of.

All you need to do is:
	loop on all pages
		add_pc_page();
		when bio is full
			chain a new bio 
	and so on.

Then at the end call blk_make_request() which will do the bouncing and
the merging. No need for all the copy/tail_only etc.. this is done by
lower levels for you already.

If you do that then Tejun is right you should do an:
	bio_map_sg()
and not:
	blk_map_sg()

Yep, allocation of command buffer if command_size > 16

Why? for example the use of not having another export.
