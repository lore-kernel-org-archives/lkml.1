Could you enhance your test to record the file size from "stat -c %s {file}"
at the end of the test, and also "dumpe2fs -c -R 'stat <inum>' {dev}"
where <inum> is from "stat -c %i {file}".  If these two don't match after
60s, or after a "sync; sync" then there will likely be a data loss.

With delalloc it is expected that the "debugfs" output will not match up
to 30s+ after the last modification, because the write is only in memory.
With ext3 this window would be much smaller, and in fact not visible from
userspace because "debugfs" would be accessing the same (in memory) buffer
as the kernel, so it can't even access the stale data on disk.

Cheers, Andreas
