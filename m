I don't know, the end result is that what device is scsi1, scsi2 is 
sometimes different when the machine boots. unfortunantly when they show 
up in the wrong order the system can't find it's boot drive

I guess that the fact that the bios is finding lilo and lilo is finding 
the kernel to try to boot is probably indicating that the hardware is 
being detected in the same order.

built-in
