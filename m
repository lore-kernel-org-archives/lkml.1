The benefit of the patch is that it makes it possible for an
application which has previously called mlockall(MCL_FUTURE) to
selectively exempt new memory mappings from memory locking, on a
per-mmap-call basis. As was pointed out earlier, there is currently no
thread-safe way for an application to do this. The earlier proposed
workaround of toggling MCL_FUTURE around calls to mmap is racy in a
multi-threaded context. Other threads may manipulate the address space
during the window where MCL_FUTURE is off, subverting the programmers
intended memory locking semantics.

The ability to exempt specific memory mappings from memory locking is
necessary when the region to be mapped is larger than physical memory.
In such cases a call to mmap the region cannot succeed, unless
MAP_UNLOCKED is available.

I agree that mlockall is a big hammer and should be avoided in most
cases, but there are situations where it is exactly what is needed. In
Gleb's instance, it sounds like he is doing some finicky performance
measurement and major page faults skew his results. In my case, I have
a realtime process where the measured latency impact of major page
faults is unacceptable. In both of these cases, mlockall is a
reasonable approach to eliminating major faults.

However, Gleb and I have independently found ourselves unable to use
mlockall because we also need to create a very large memory mapping
(for which we don't care about major faults). The proposed
MAP_UNLOCKED flag would allow us to override MCL_FUTURE for that one
mapping.

And other issues arise. Gleb described a situation where the use of
mlockall is justified, identified an issue which prevents its use, and
provided a patch which resolves that issue. Why are you focusing on
the validity of using mlockall?

There is an objective reason: the current interaction between
mlockall(MCL_FUTURE) and mmap has a deficiency. In 'normal' mode,
without MCL_FUTURE in force, the default is that new memory mappings
are not locked, but mmap provides MAP_LOCKED specifically to override
that default. However, with MCL_FUTURE toggled to on, there is no
analogous way to tell mmap to override the default. The proposed
MAP_UNLOCKED flag would resolve this deficiency.
