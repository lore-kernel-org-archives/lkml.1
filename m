Actually, my point is that damage typically impacts a cluster of disk 
sectors that are adjacent. Think of a drive that has junk on the platter 
or a some such thing - the contamination is likely to be localized.

I really am not a big retry fan for most modern drives - the drive will 
try really, really hard to complete an IO for us and multiple retries 
can just slow down the higher level application from recovering.

I think that we need to play with some of these possible solutions on 
some  real-world bad drives and see how they react. 

We should definitely talk more about this at the workshop ;-)
