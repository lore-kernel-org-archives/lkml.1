Whoops, for some reason I had gotten the idea that you wrote 
wait_scan_init().

I had exactly the same thought, but it seemed less intrusive to keep
the dividing line where Arjan put it.

You forgot to move the dev_set_drvdata() call into the synchronous 
part.  Apart from that it looks fine.  Should I submit it officially?

Also, I do still think that wait_scan_init() needs an extra call to 
async_synchronize_full() at the end.
