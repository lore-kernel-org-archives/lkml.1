Great, thanks Jens.

So, one compromise may be to change the barriers on ext3 to look like the 
patch Ted just sent out for ext4.  It should be mostly safe to skip the 
barrier between the log blocks and the commit block since the drive is likely 
to do those sequentially anyway.  A little extra logic could be added to 
detect log wrapping and force an extra barrier in that case.

Reiserfs saw some significant performance gains when I changed the code from:

write log blocks
barrier
wait on log blocks
write commit
barrier
wait on commit

to

write log blocks
barrier
write commit
barrier
wait on all of them

Both were tested with the great big emc power failure machine and both passed.  
In the event of an IO error on log blocks, we should zero out the commit.
