Thanks. I'm asking because some days ago I tried to create a 10T ext3
filesytem on a linear software raid over two hardware raids, and it
failed horribly. mke2fs from e2fsprogs-1.39 refused to create such a
large filesystem but did it with -F, and I could mount it afterwards.
But writing data immediately produced zillions of errors and only
power-cycling the box helped.

We're now using a 7.9T filesystem on the same hardware. That seems
to work fine on 2.6.21-rc2, so I think this is an ext3 problem. I
cannot completely rule out other reasons though as the underlying
qla2xxx driver also had some problems on earlier kernels.

We'd much rather have a 10T filesystem if possible. So if you have
time to look into the issue I would be willing to recreate the 10T
filesystem and send details.

Regards
Andre
