Probably, I'm not sufficiently smart, but benefits of "TCM v3.2" aren't 
obvious for me at all. Could you list them point by point?

Especially interesting, why the above mentioned features can't be added 
in the STGT instead of creating something a whole new?

I looked there many times. Hardware target drivers fundamentally 
different from software drivers, because they need to do some processing 
on IRQ level. You can't test the corresponding target's framework 
branches and prove they provide sufficient functionality using a driver, 
which doesn't need such functionality.

Addition of new non-process related entries in /proc is fully forbidden 
and it doesn't matter if those entries used on "control path" or in 
corner cases.
