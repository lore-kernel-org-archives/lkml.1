Let me try reiterate the problem with code, please correct me if I'm
wrong.

1) normal fs sets I_DIRTY_DATASYNC when extending i_size, however NFS
   will set the flag for any pages written -- why this trick? To
   guarantee the call of nfs_commit_inode()? Which unfortunately turns
   almost every server side NFS write into sync writes..

 writeback_single_inode:
    do_writepages
      nfs_writepages
        nfs_writepage ----[short time later]---> nfs_writeback_release*
                                                   nfs_mark_request_commit
                                                     __mark_inode_dirty(I_DIRTY_DATASYNC);
                                    
    if (I_DIRTY_SYNC || I_DIRTY_DATASYNC)  <---- so this will be true for most time
      write_inode
        nfs_write_inode
          nfs_commit_inode


2) NFS commit stops pipeline because it sleep&wait inside i_mutex,
   which blocks all other NFSDs trying to write/writeback the inode.

   nfsd_sync:
     take i_mutex
       filemap_fdatawrite
       filemap_fdatawait
     drop i_mutex
     
   If filemap_fdatawait() can be moved out of i_mutex (or just remove
   the lock), we solve the root problem:

   nfsd_sync:
     [take i_mutex]
       filemap_fdatawrite  => can also be blocked, but less a problem
     [drop i_mutex]
       filemap_fdatawait
 
   Maybe it's a dumb question, but what's the purpose of i_mutex here?
   For correctness or to prevent livelock? I can imagine some livelock
   problem here (current implementation can easily wait for extra
   pages), however not too hard to fix.


The proposed patch essentially takes two actions in nfs_file_write()
- to start writeback when the per-file nr_dirty goes high
  without committing
- to throttle dirtying when the per-file nr_writeback goes high
  I guess this effectively prevents pdflush from kicking in with
  its bad committing behavior

In general it's reasonable to keep NFS per-file nr_dirty low, however
questionable to do per-file nr_writeback throttling. This does not
work well with the global limits - eg. when there are many dirty
files, the summed-up nr_writeback will still grow out of control.
And it's more likely to impact user visible responsiveness than
a global limit. But my opinion can be biased -- me have a patch to
do global NFS nr_writeback limit ;)

Thanks,
Fengguang
