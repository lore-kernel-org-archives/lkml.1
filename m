Basically we're going to wind up listening for SUBSYSTEM=block hotplug 
events.  What would be helpful is if 
/sys/block/$foo/device/{model,vendor} were populated when we get the 
event (or, since there are good reasons why they're not, if we got 
another event afterwards that said they'd been populated).

Even more helpful if there were also sysfs attributes for serial numbers 
and such from INQUIRY VPD data.  That would make probing for the 
*correct* drive(s) much simpler.
