Right, it still does this.  Currently hal is taking 0 in the
media_change file to mean I don't support AN.

Yes, that's why we're having the argument ... it's the use of the event
in the absence of AN that people care about.

It didn't show a list to userspace ... it's a single file with a 0 or 1
value.  0 means doesn't support AN, 1 means does.

It's still a single file with a 0 or 1 value.  0 means doesn't support
AN, 1 means does.

Well, if they have the same userspace effect, and display the same
information to userspace, it's a bit hard to see how a user would
distinguish them, yes.

The current published API is the media_events file.  HAL is using that
to indicate support for AN.  This is why we can't simply change it to 1
wholesale because we'll confuse HAL (HAL still has to send polling
events if AN isn't supported).

So, the best fix for 2.6.25 at the current -rc6 is to keep the meaning
of the media_change file the same (0 for no AN, 1 for AN) and let HAL
take the polled events via udev, which basically means it's preserving
the behaviour and isn't a regression.

For 2.6.26 we can add a new media_events_polled (or some other name)
file, fix the sysfs ro attribute and make them true writeable filters so
some raving user can turn off polled events if they want and everyone
will be happy.
