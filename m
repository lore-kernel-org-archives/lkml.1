If such thing would exist may be I would have used it since swapping out
of a wrong page is not live or death matter in my case, but mlockall()
provides me with exactly what I need and without swapping out wrong
pages. Speaking about adding such madvise call wouldn't it be even
harder to justify? It obviously not good enough for real-time use and my
case, I admit, is unusual. Also if we start prioritise memory why stop
on binary, why not set value like "this memory is more important then
that memory by factor of 5"?
