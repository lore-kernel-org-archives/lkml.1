IMO the main advantage of moving block allocation down to the OSD target
is more apparent with distributed file systems a-la pNFS over objects
where paralleling that task is a key for scalable performance.

The thing is that the target needs to implement its own mapping from
object logical offsets into disk blocks and this is usually done
using some kind of a (possibly trimmed down) local file system.
Therefore the I/O performance of a single OSD is likely to be similar
to a single file server's.  I'm not sure what will be case comparing
an OSD with a local file system mounted over a block device over
a storage network, e.g. FC or iSCSI - that could be an interesting
research topic.  I guess that the main issue there is to cache enough
metadata on the host to minimize transfer latencies (assuming
latency of a directly attached device is always better than
a fabric-attached one).

Anyhow, capacity management via partitions and object allocation,
plus quotas, and the fine grain OSD security model is a big one
that's worth investigating, to say the least.

One direction is to mount the file system over an object or a set
of object exported via exofs using mount -o loop.
And the user doesn't have to be necessarily a filesystem. It could
be a database either...  or anything that's typically working
over a block device.

I can understand representing a single object as a block device (although I
think that using a file for that should be good enough and easier) but
why representing the whole OSD as a block device?  The OSD holds partitions
and objects each with attributes and OSD security related support.  Hence
representing that in a namespace using a filesystem seems straight forward.
