Apply signature checking to modules on module load, checking the signature
against the ring of public keys compiled into the kernel (if enabled by
CONFIG_MODULE_SIG).  Turning on signature checking will also force the module's
ELF metadata to be verified first.

These patches have been in use by RHEL and Fedora kernels for years, and so
have been thoroughly tested.  The signed modules survive both the debuginfo
separation performed by rpmbuild and the strip performed when modules are being
reduced as much as possible before being included in an initial ramdisk
composition.  Signed modules have been tested to work with LE and BE, 32- and
64-bit arch kernels, including i386, x86_64, ppc64, ia64, s390 and s390x.

There are several reasons why these patches are useful, amongst which are:

 (1) to protect against accidentally-corrupted modules causing damage;

 (2) to protect against maliciously modified modules causing damage;

 (3) to allow a sysadmin (or more likely an IT department) to enforce a policy
     that only known and approved modules shall be loaded onto machines which
     they're expected to support;

 (4) to allow other support providers to do likewise, or at least to _detect_
     the fact that unsupported modules are loaded;

 (5) to allow the detection of modules replaced by a second-order distro or a
     preloaded Linux purveyor.

Basically, these patches have two main appeals to me: (a) preventing malicious
modules from being loaded, and (b) reducing support workload by pointing out
modules on a crashing box that aren't what they're expected to be.

Now, this is not a complete solution by any means: the core kernel is not
protected, and nor are /dev/mem or /dev/kmem, but it denies (or at least
controls) one relatively simple attack vector.

This facility is optional: the builder of a kernel is by no means under any
requirement to actually enable it, let alone force the set of loadable modules
to be restricted to just those that the builder provides (there are degrees of
restriction available).


Use of the module signing facility is documentated in:

	Documentation/module-signing.txt

which I've included here for reference:

			==============================
			KERNEL MODULE SIGNING FACILITY
			==============================

The module signing facilitiy applies cryptographic signature checking to
modules on module load, checking the signature against a ring of public keys
compiled into the kernel.  GPG is used to do the cryptographic work and
determines the format of the signature and key data.  The facility uses GPG's
MPI library to handle the huge numbers involved.

This facility is enabled through CONFIG_MODULE_SIG.  Turning on signature
checking will also force the module's ELF metadata to be verified before the
signature is checked.


=====================
SUPPLYING PUBLIC KEYS
=====================

A set of public keys must be supplied at main kernel compile time.  This is
done by taking a GPG public key file, running it through the kernel's bin2c
program and writing the result over crypto/signature/key.h.  To automate this
process, something like this could be done:

	cat >genkey <<EOF
	%pubring kernel.pub
	%secring kernel.sec
	Key-Type: DSA
	Key-Length: 512
	Name-Real: A. N. Other
	Name-Comment: Kernel Module GPG key
	%commit
	EOF
	make scripts/bin2c
	gpg --homedir . --batch --gen-key genkey
	gpg --homedir . --export --keyring kernel.pub keyname |
	 scripts/bin2c ksign_def_public_key __initdata >crypto/signature/key.h

The above generates fresh keys using /dev/random.  If there's insufficient data
in /dev/random, more can be provided more by running:

	rngd -r /dev/urandom

in the background.

Note:

 (1) That "keyname" is the name of the key in the keyring.  This differentiates
     it from any other keys that may be added to the keyring.

 (2) That no GPG password is used in the above scriptlet.

 (3) It may be desirable to shred and delete the private key file after signing
     the modules.


==============
MODULE SIGNING
==============

Modules will then be signed automatically.  The kernel make command line can
include the following options:

 (*) MODSECKEY=<secret-key-ring-path>

     This indicates the whereabouts of the GPG keyring that is the source of
     the secret key to be used.  The default is "./kernel.sec".

 (*) MODPUBKEY=<public-key-ring-path>

     This indicates the whereabouts of the GPG keyring that is the source of
     the public key to be used.  The default is "./kernel.pub".

 (*) MODKEYNAME=<key-name>

     The name of the key pair to be used from the aforementioned keyrings.
     This defaults to being unset, thus leaving the choice of default key to
     gpg.

 (*) KEYFLAGS="gpg-options"

     Override the complete gpg command line, including the preceding three
     options.  The default options supplied to gpg are:

	--no-default-keyring
	--secret-keyring $(MODSECKEY)
	--keyring $(MODPUBKEY)
	--no-default-keyring
	--homedir .
	--no-options
	--no-auto-check-trustdb
	--no-permission-warning

      with:

	--default-key $(MODKEYNAME)

      being added if requested.

The resulting module.ko file will be the signed module.


========================
STRIPPING SIGNED MODULES
========================

Signed modules may be safely stripped as the signature only covers those parts
of the module the kernel actually uses and any ELF metadata required to deal
with them.  Any necessary ELF metadata that is affected by stripping is
canonicalised by the sig generator and the sig checker to hide strip effects.

This permits the debuginfo to be detached from the module and placed in another
spot so that gdb can find it when referring to that module without the need for
multiple signed versions of the module.  Such is done by rpmbuild when
producing RPMs.

It also permits the module to be stripped as far as possible for when modules
are being reduced prior to being included in an initial ramdisk composition.


======================
LOADING SIGNED MODULES
======================

Modules are loaded with insmod, exactly as for unsigned modules.  The signature
is inserted into the module object file as an ELF section called ".module_sig".
The signature checker will spot it and apply signature checking.


=========================================
NON-VALID SIGNATURES AND UNSIGNED MODULES
=========================================

If CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE is enabled or "enforcemodulesig=1" is supplied on
the kernel command line, the kernel will _only_ load validly signed modules
for which it has a public key.  Otherwise, it will also load modules that are
unsigned.  Any module for which the kernel has a key, but which proves to have
a signature mismatch will not be permitted to load (returning EKEYREJECTED).

This table indicates the behaviours of the various situations:

	MODULE STATE			PERMISSIVE MODE	ENFORCING MODE
	===============================	===============	===============
	Unsigned			Ok		EKEYREJECTED
	Signed, no public key		ENOKEY		ENOKEY
	Validly signed, public key	Ok		Ok
	Invalidly signed, public key	EKEYREJECTED	EKEYREJECTED
	Validly signed, expired key	EKEYEXPIRED	EKEYEXPIRED
	Corrupt signature		ELIBBAD		ELIBBAD
	Corrupt ELF			ELIBBAD		ELIBBAD
