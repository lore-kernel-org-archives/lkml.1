There may be a bug somewhere, but write_cache_pages() looks correct.
It locks the page then checks for page->mapping to make sure the page
wasn't truncated.  And truncation (including invalidatepage()) happens
with the page locked, so that can't race with page writeback.

However the do_invalidatepage() in block_write_full_page() looks
suspicious.  It calls invalidatepage(), but doesn't perform all the
other things needed for truncation.  Maybe there's a valid reason for
that, but I really don't have any idea what.
