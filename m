Err, not quite. See, we truncate clock->xtime_nsec when we shift it down
and store it into xtime.tv_nsec. Since we don't want to lose truncated
remainder, we simply add one to xtime.tv_nsec, taking the ceiling in
effect.

However, we have to balance this out in order to not rush forward in
time each tick. So we accumulate amount we ended up adding into the
error.

Lets walk through a simple example with actual values.
b = 99
c = 4

=> a = (b >> c) + 1
   r = b - (a << c)

=> a = (99 >> 4) + 1
   a = 6 + 1
   a = 7

   r = 99 - (7 << 4)
   r = 99 - 112
   r = -13

(Your reduction would give -16, since it ignores that shift down
truncates)

In effect, adding 1 to xtime.tv_nsec, is the same as adding 13 to
clock->xtime_nsec.


Maybe a different way of expressing what we're calculating is the
following:

xtime.tv_nsec = (clock->xtime_nsec + (1<<clock->shift)) >> clock->shift
clock->xtime_nsec = (1<<clock->shift) 
			- (clock->xtime_nsec &((1<<clock->shift)-1)

In other words: The rounded up portion - the masked remainder in
xtime_nsec.

Does that make sense?
