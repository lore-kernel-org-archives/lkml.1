It would be nice to have a comment here explaining the overall design. 
it's a bit opaque working that out from the raw implementation.

OK, the lock is needed on 32-bit machines, I guess.

OK.  The multiplication of an unsigned by 1000 could overflow, but only
if HZ is less than 0.25.  I don't think we need worry about that ;)

We should have schedule_hrtimeout_uninterruptible(), but we don't.

Every field in that structure is carefully documented (except for
j_last_sync_writer - what vandal did that?)

please fix.
