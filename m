No, changes in R will be seen on the filesystem.
The metadata buffer for block B is marked as dirty when it is unfiled
whether the journal has aborted or not.  Eventually the buffer will be
written-back to the filesystem by pdflush.  Actually I have confirmed
this behavior by using SystemTap.  So if both journal abort and
system crash happen at the same time, the filesystem would become
inconsistent state.  As I stated, replaying the journaled block B in
transaction A may also corrupt the filesystem, because changes in
transaction R are reflected halfway.  That is why I sent a patch to
prevent metadata buffers from being dirtied on abort.
