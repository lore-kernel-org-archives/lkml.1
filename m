That's not true.

The plugging is often across multiple threads. It didn't _use_ to be (we 
always unplugged at wait), but it is now. Nothing else explains why that 
patch by Ted makes such a big throughput thing, because the code did

      ret = submit_bh(WRITE_SYNC, bh);
      wait_on_buffer(bh);

ie it very much submits a _single_ IO, and waits on it. If plugging made a 
difference, that means that unplugging was delayed so long that somebody 
else does IO too - ie it gets delayed past a wait event.

So according to your own rules, that submit_bh() _should_ use WRITE_SYNC, 
but something bad happens if it does. I'm not quite seeing _what_, though, 
unless there are multiple processes trying to dirty the _same_ buffer, and 
they win if they all can dirty it without doing IO on it in between (and 
then the write turns into just one write).
