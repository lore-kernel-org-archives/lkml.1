No, I wouldn't say that that's better either, but that's also not how I
suggested cleaning reworking it. We have existing conventions for how
complex blocks are broken down in to more readable forms which you seem
to have issues grasping. My point is that you are purposely obfuscating
things, and therefore your entire rationale is suspect at best.

This isn't a subjective thing as you are now trying to spin it. There are
existing conventions that the majority of kernel code follows and any of
your above obfuscated blocks are unlikely to show up in any code outside
of drivers/. How about actually reading through the coding style document
and existing code before attempting to cripple checkpatch.

You've also ignored everything that was stated about the reasons for why
we have this limit and why it is useful, instead focusing purely on the
fact that I've taken issue with your bogus examples that would never have
been applied in the first place.

If you simply wanted a way to get around the limit, then something like
Bart's patch is quite reasonable and I don't believe anyone has any
objections to it. This half-baked rationale for tossing it out completely
using examples that don't even show up in the kernel though is simply
nonsense. Perhaps if you spent half as much time auditing vendor patches
you would have some idea of why having these warnings is not just a nice
thing to have, but also the only sensible default.
