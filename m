a6037b61c2f5fc99c57c15b26d7cfa58bbb34008 should have fixed the mentioned
issue (along with the deadlock mentioned in the changelog).

The issue was that you could enqueue an expired timer, run it in place,
enqueue it again, etc..

The current code would not run it in place, but instead fire a softirq
to handle it. That opens up a preemption window.

Note, this can only happen with HRTIMER_RESTART timers, and those should
be careful to avoid hogging the CPU anyway.

Doesn't this s390 thing have a sysrq key you can press to get some
traces out?
