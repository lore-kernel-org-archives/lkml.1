That's your drive reporting that it saw transmission error on the wire.

And a write command timed out which is also often caused by transmission
problems.

No, according to the log, there was no slow down.  Transmission speed is
lowered only after some number of errors have accumulated.

For SATA drives, occasional transmission problems are expected even on
otherwise pretty healthy systems.  No need to worry about it too much
unless the problem repeats itself a lot.
