I would strike the entire mention of MD devices since it is your assertion, not 
a proven fact. You will cause more data loss from common events (single sector 
errors, complete drive failure) by steering people away from more reliable 
storage configurations because of a really rare edge case (power failure during 
split write to two raid members while doing a RAID rebuild).

All users who care about data integrity - including those who do not use MD5 but 
just regular single S-ATA disks - will get better reliability from a UPS.

This is very misleading. All storage "can" have silent data loss, you are making 
a statement without specifics about frequency.

FSCK can repair the file system metadata, but will not detect any data loss or 
corruption in the data blocks allocated to user files. To detect data loss 
properly, you need to checksum (or digitally sign) all objects stored in a file 
system and verify them on a regular basis.

Also helps to keep a separate list of those objects on another device so that 
when the metadata does take a hit, you can enumerate your objects and verify 
that you have not lost anything.
