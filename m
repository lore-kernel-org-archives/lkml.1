This is really an easy thing to do.
It can be achieved without a huge retro-fit.
It can happen even without yet another macro.
(Not saying that there should not be a new macro or new function,
just that we can enjoy unique message IDs without those mechanisms.)

Point to note: the message tag has to be unique.
The tag is what's relevant, what gets catalogued.

I don't really see the value of a hash per se.
What Martin has suggested (unless I have misunderstood) is
the driver name combined with some index number ==> unique msg id.
That's not exactly a "hash".  (One can generate a hash from it,
but why bother?  You've got a unique string already.)

Then Tim Hockin wrote:

Whether hashed or not, what's needed is premeditated reporting,
intentional dividing between variable content (like device ID)
and the explanatory text arround it.  Prefix each line with a token
(or as most are calling it, a "tag") that can be looked up off-line.

I hope no one is thinking gettext in this thread.
Don't clutter the kernel with something like gettext.

And don't burden the kernel with run-time text crunching.
Message codes go in when the module is written.
They get looked up either in user space or off-line.
Easy!  Almost trivial!
