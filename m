the right type for the type of cable you choose to use. yes it's the same 
disk, but by choosing to hook it up in a different way you get different 
results from it (different performance, different predictability)

again, if you want to have a udev rule that then maps these different name 
onto the same name, more power to you, but why do you insist on makeing 
_everyone_ work that way (or go to significant extra effort to find the 
info in the changing directory structure of sysfs to track down the info 
that you throw away)

definantly.
