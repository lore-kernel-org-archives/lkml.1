  As much as I don't like the using /proc/mountinfo for this, it also
has the advantage that it nicely solves the problem with a filesystem
being bind-mounted on several directories...  Otherwise you have to
solve the problem which mountpoint of the filesystem should be used
(especially because the real root of the filesystem need not be
accessible from the namespace of the process).

  Generally, it is an unclear question how should kernel identify a
filesystem where the problem happened. We could have a kobject for
superblock but it's still unclear how to map this to a device /
mountpoints because that's what userspace ultimately wants to tell the
sysadmin and possibly make some automated decision.
  What currently seems as the cleanest solution to me, is to add some
"filesystem identifier" field to /proc/self/mountinfo (which could be
UUID, superblock pointer or whatever) and pass this along with the error
message to userspace. Passing could be done either via sysfs (but I
agree it isn't the best fit because a filesystem need not be bound to a
device) or just via generic netlink (which has the disadvantage that you
cannot use the udev framework everyone knows)...
