This sounds iffy, why not just leave the page in the pagecache if its
mapped anyway?

Have you seen the new launder_page() a_op? called from
invalidate_inode_pages2_range()

Isn't there still a race where the page fault path doesn't yet lock the
page and can just reinsert it?

Nick's pagefault rework should rid us of this by always locking the page
in the fault path.
