.. and btw, just to put that into perspective - I ended up running with 
that repeated 'dd+sync+rm' in the background for quite a while, and the 
machine was in no way unusable. I don't think I saw a single "ooh, that 
feels really dead" case with anticipatory, although I saw several "bad 
stutter" cases.

Of course, with the whole "overwrite" case, things are really much 
smoother, and I can hardly notice anything happening at all. Although I 
_do_ get an occasional 200-600ms fsync hickup, and I can tell those very 
clearly. But if that was the worst I'd ever see, I'd be a very happy 
person. It's a good goal to have, I suspect.
