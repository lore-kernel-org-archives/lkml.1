Actually, there is ... it's what you're doing: use a coherent mask of 32
bits and a dma mask of 64bits.

The aic79xx has exactly the same problem (its internal sequencer only
has a 32 bit wide programme counter, so it can only execute sequencer
scripts if they're in the first 4GB of memory).  I think it's fairly
common amongst intelligent controllers that are old enough to have been
32 bit only but which got extended to work on 64 bits.

To get ordinary memory for this, you just use GFP_DMA32 as has been
previously stated.
