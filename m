You would need to call it before you could attempt to register any
devices.  So fairly early on in the initialisation of sbp2/usb-storage.

Yes, I do see the problem.  There's no way the SCSI core can know when
a driver has finished scanning, so I've punted to the driver to set its
own timeout here.  I know that new devices really can show up at any
time, but I think it's reasonable to say that if a machine is booted
with the same configuration as last time, the drives should show up with
the same names.
