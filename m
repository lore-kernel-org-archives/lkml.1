Please include a complete (and suitably updated) copy of the changelog
with each iteration of a patch.

Well, wait_for_completion_timeout() is only going to return when the
timeout timed out, or someone ran complete().

So..  we shouldn't need the timeout here at all - just use
wait_for_completion().

static int scan_thread(ctlr_info_t *h)
{
	DECLARE_COMPLETION_ONSTACK(wait);

	h->rescan_wait = &wait;
	for ( ; ; ) {
		wait_for_completion(&wait);
		if (kthread_should_stop())
			break;
		rebuild_lun_table(h, 0);
	}
	return 0;
}

And on the teardown path, do

	complete(...);
	kthread_stop(...);

?
