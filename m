I experimented today with an ia64-only solution, keeping track of
'present' vs 'enabled' vs 'online' all in arch-specific code.

The arch-specific stuff turns out to be more or less a wash; that
is, it's not too hard to keep it all in ia64.

However, the problem is, I would still need a generic
'enabled_map' to control whether 'online' and 'crash_notes'
entries get created for /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuN/.

So if other archs are at least neutral on this class of CPUs, I
can work on another patchset that lowers the tax to a simple
#define for archs that don't care.

But if people hate this idea of a new map, I'd like to know so
that I'm not wasting my time and can work on a different solution
(what that would be, I have no idea at the moment).

Thanks.
