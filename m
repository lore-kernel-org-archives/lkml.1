I tried that - I have seen no problems so far. But it is not the first time=
 I=20
did not see the problem for some time.

Btw, postgres just creates the database by copying over a default database.

=46or an easy test with sparse files, I created a big one, set it up as a l=
oop=20
device, created a filesystem and ran some stuff in it.
No Problem so far.

It definitely was before a reboot. And there were plenty of both, inodes an=
d=20
blocks.

I think that I have seen the problem on metadata only changes (find /tmp -t=
ype=20
f|xargs touch) as well, but sometimes metadata changes were possible while =
file=20
creation was not.

Another Datapoint: File deletion sometimes made it possible to create more=
=20
files, but by far not as much as the space freed.

There were over 200GB free, so I doubt that. I don't know what could have=20
caused an allocation of so much space unnoticed in an idle system multiple=
=20
times.
But I do understand the reason for the question ;-)
