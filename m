DWARF2 is capable of extracting information only when not optimized away
by the compiler. That's the whole point of markers : liveness is good in
this case because we make sure the variable is there, not that it
*might* be there. The latter case might be good enough for a debugger,
but not for a production system tracer.

The builtin expect will take care to put the instructions out of the
hot paths and therefore leave them out of the icache with gcc
-freorder-blocks (in -O2). The only addition to the frequently used
icache is, in this case, the 5 bytes jump, 2 bytes mov, 2 bytes test and
2 (or 6) bytes conditional branch, for a total of 11 bytes for small
functions and 15 bytes for functions which require near jumps.

The runtime cost of function call is bigger than the jump. I don't see
what this buys us.

It could be possible to do so. However, passing a variable argument list
to a marker is rather more flexible than those inline assembly
constraints. And you are still tied to the variable names and offer no
abstraction between the kernel implementation and the conceptual name
associated to a traced variable.
