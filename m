Probably agreed here, xtime_nsec probably should be converted to a s64
as negative values are possible.


However, Its unclear to me if my patch worked or not? 
Did you try it alone?

Yes, after Romans patch we do basically store the remainder in
xtime_nsec, however we then use that to add to error and xtime_nsec
isn't used until it is cleared the next time we hit update_wall_clock.

So yea, xtime_nsec scope is now basically a local variable right now,
but there is code in subfunctions that use it so we didn't change it
totally. I agree there is some cleanup needed here.

By this you probably disabled the clock steering. Still not sure how it
affected the issue.

So if the shift value is 8, that likely means the jiffies clock is still
in use here and we haven't switched to the TOD clocksource.

That could be acceptable. clocksource_adjust() can do some negative
steering and still have correct output.

Me too. Its a little hard to unpack everything you've gone through here,
as some of your assumptions aren't quite right. Its understandable as
this code is fairly dense, and has evolved over the last couple of years
to handle a number of corner cases found. 

But its likely some cleanup here is in order to shake out these signed
shift issues that were not part of the original design.
