Can't we just invoke the last sector handling flag for all Nokia
devices?

This would cause tape errors on unit attention (fairly common
condition).  It can be argued that we get more users of USB mobile
phones than tapes, but I'd rather keep both communities happy

By and large, the reason we backport from head if at all possible is so
we can avoid bugs like this creeping into stable.  (And backporting from
head is far easier if the bug fixes are small and don't contain
miscellaneous code clean ups, control flow changes and comment fixes)

I tried to untangle it on the 'plane yesterday.  I've just got a bit
more testing to do then I'll post the patch to your patch.
