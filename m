ok. I have applied all but this one:

i think it's much simpler to do what i have below. Could you try it on 
your box? Or if it is using ACPI idle - in that case the callbacks 
should already be there and there should be no need for further fixups.

ok, i took this one out.

Subject: x86: idle wakeup event in the HLT loop
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>

do a proper idle-wakeup event on HLT as well - some CPUs stop the TSC
in HLT too, not just when going through the ACPI methods.

(the ACPI idle code already does this.)

[ update the 64-bit side too, as noticed by Jiri Slaby. ]
