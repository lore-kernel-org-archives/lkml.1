"To try and rule out a faulty userspace program, I marked the file as 
read-only (chmod a-w) and immutable (chattr +i).  After a reboot, the 
file was still read-only and immutable, yet it still became corrupted."

Since the immutable bit is not respected, I tend to think it is a kernel 
problem.  Unless the filesystem isn't getting unmounted/flushed properly 
for some reason... but I thought the modern kernel had that covered.

I agree it is very suspicious this happens only after upgrading libc.  
I'll see if I can find an individual change in libc locale-handling that 
might trigger this.

Thanks
Alan
