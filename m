There another question I have: does the writeback go through the io
scheduler? Because no matter the io scheduler or the tuning done, the
writeback algorithm totally starves the reads.

See the url below for an example with CFQ, but deadline or noop all show
this behaviour:
http://94.100.113.33/535450001-535500000/535451701-535451800/535451800_6_L7g

Is there anything I can do about this behaviour by creating a better
interleaving of the reads and writes?
