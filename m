If I get a DMA timeout on my disk, I want to know about it.  If I get
an OOM kill, I want to know about it.  Etc.

I *don't* want every application to participate in system monitoring,
and that's what it seems you're suggesting.  I want a monitoring
daemon which is notified of important system events.  We like to
report these things in various ways, including squirting them out onto
the network.

I *don't* want to run regexes against dmesg or /var/log/messages or
/var/log/kernel every N seconds, that's just a gross hack.  I really
want first-class notifications of significant events.  I don't mind
having to do parsing of events - as I said before, they can even be
loosely structured strings.  They just need to be more important than
a plain old printk(), and preferably come through a different channel.

I understand that many users will not want this level of monitoring,
and that's why it should be flexible enough to devolve into printk().
But we have thousands of systems.  I need a better view of what is
happening.
