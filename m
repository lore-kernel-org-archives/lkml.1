I spent a bunch of time hammering on different ways to fix this without
increasing nr_requests, and it was a mixture of needing better tuning in
btrfs and needing to init mapping->writeback_index on inode allocation.

So, today's numbers for creating 30 kernel trees in sequence:

Btrfs defaults                  57.41 MB/s
Btrfs dup no csum               74.59 MB/s 
Btrfs no duplication            76.83 MB/s
Btrfs no dup no csum no inline  76.85 MB/s

Ext4 data=writeback, delalloc   60.50 MB/s

I may be able to get the duplication numbers higher by tuning metadata
writeback.  My current code doesn't push metadata throughput as high in
order to give some spindle time to data writes.

This graph may give you an idea of how the duplication goes to disk:

Compared with the result of mkfs.btrfs -m single (no duplication):

http://oss.oracle.com/~mason/seekwatcher/btrfs-dup/btrfs-single.png

Both on one graph is a little hard to read:

Here is btrfs with duplication on, but without checksumming.  Even with
inline extents on, the checksums seem to cause most of the metadata
related syncing (they are stored in the btree):

http://oss.oracle.com/~mason/seekwatcher/btrfs-dup/btrfs-dup-nosum.png

It is worth noting that with checksumming on, I go through async
kthreads to do the checksumming and they may be reordering the IO a bit
as they submit things.  So, I'm not 100% sure the extra seeks aren't
coming from my async code.

And Ext4:

http://oss.oracle.com/~mason/seekwatcher/btrfs-dup/ext4-writeback.png

This benchmark has questionable real world value, but since it includes
a number of smallish files it is a good place to look at the cost of
metadata and metadata dup

I'll push the btrfs related changes for this out tonight after some
stress testing.
