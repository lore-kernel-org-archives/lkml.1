You definitely are a complete nutter ;)

It's not really simple in general even then. The problems come with file 
handles, and two big issues in particular:

 - handling a reboot (of the server) without impacting the client really 
   does need a "look up by file handle" operation (which you can do by 
   logging the pathname to filehandle translation, but it certainly gets 
   problematic).

 - non-Unix-like filesystems don't necessarily have a stable "st_ino" 
   field (ie it may change over a rename or have no meaning what-so-ever, 
   things like that), and that makes trying to generate a filehandle 
   really interesting for them.

I do agree that it's possible - we obviously _did_ have a user-level NFSD 
for a long while, after all - but it's quite painful if you want to handle 
things well. Only allowing access through the NFSD certainly helps a lot, 
but still doesn't make it quite as trivial as you claim ;)

Of course, I think you can make NFSv4 to use volatile filehandles instead 
of the traditional long-lived ones, and that really should avoid almost 
all of the problems with doing a NFSv4 server in user space. However, I'd 
expect there to be clients that don't do the whole volatile thing, or 
support the file handle becoming stale only at certain well-defined points 
(ie after renames, not at random reboot times).
