  - move the networking core's facilities to build the default name of
    an interface into lib/
  - expand it to optionally use base-26 numbering (a...nn...zzz) as
    alternative to decimal numbering
  - let SCSI low-level drivers optionally provide a short constant
    string, resembling its transport name, in the host template or
    transport template
  - let SCSI high-level driver make use of the new naming functions in
    lib/, providing either just "sd", "sr" etc. or "sd-$transport-" as
    name prefix

No patch yet, and alas I'm currently short of spare time.
