cgroups support multiple hierarchy and it allows to have different
divisions of tasks among hierarchy like below:

                                 PIDs
   mem+swap /hier1/grp1/tasks <= 1, 2, 3, 4
   blkio    /hier2/grp2/tasks <= 1, 2
                   grp3/tasks <= 3, 4

Don't we need to consider this case?

Thanks,
