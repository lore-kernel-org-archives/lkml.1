Depending on who you are asking for.

Yup. It may. But in showed case it is not. In showed case it showed a
bug. Which you call a feature.

But right now _everything_ is presented. All things are in places.
Disk drivers, filesystem, and even that stupid console/tty driver.
It _IS_ in the kernel.

You introduce so naive rules for the initramfs userspace... It should
not use console, it should not load modules, which may load another
one... What next, not to use syscalls? Sigh, instead of thinking on how
to fix the weak boot process so that next time similar problem arises,
we ended up with pointing a finger one to another... Hope we will not
get another similar cases though.
