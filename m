Hello

Doing some performance test between ext3 and ext4 I noticed that ext4
is not much faster or in some cases slower then ext3. Two years ago when
I tested ext4 it was a lot faster then ext3 (see my mail:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/6/65). Doing some simple tests with bonnie++
I got the following results:

For this system the write performance is the most important factor and one
can see today ext4 is marginally faster then ext3. But 2 years ago ext4 was
a lot faster (~270MB against ~223MB).

Using my own benchmark afdbench where many process copy thousands of small
files around the results are as follows:

   For ext3: 5449.76 files per second 15.58 MiB/s
   For ext4: 5162.16 files per second 15.48 MiB/s

So in this test ext4 is a bit slower then ext3. Since afdbench has seen
considerable changes, one cannot compare these results with those 2 years
ago. But 2 years ago ext4 was 12% faster then ext3.

Test where done with kernel 2.6.25.4 and file system where created as follows:

    ext3: mke2fs -b 4096 -m 0 -O dir_index,large_file,filetype,has_journal,sparse_super -j /dev/md7
    ext4: mke2fs -b 4096 -E test_fs -m 0 -O dir_index,large_file,filetype,has_journal,sparse_super -j /dev/md7

And both where mounted with the following options:

    noatime,nodiratime,commit=15

2 years ago I used 2.6.16.8 but the hardware is still the same. So what has
happened with the performance of ext4? I noticed that 2 years ago I could
use extents+mballoc+delalloc, now there is only extents+mballoc in the
current kernels. Could delalloc make the big difference? I saw that
in Andrew Morton mm tree delalloc is included. Unfortunately when I tried using
2.6.26-rc2-mm1 a sync would never return and there where lot of other
odd things, so I could not do any tests with delalloc.

So any idea what I am doing wrong or what I could do to improve those numbers?
Please CC me since I am not subscribed to the list.

Thanks,
Holger
