It sleeps for one jiffy, not one second.

This is all a bit mysterious.  That delay doesn't have much at all to
do with commit times.  The code is looping around giving other
userspace processes an opportunity to get scheduled and to run an fsync
and to join the current transaction rather than having to start a new
one.

(that code was quite effective when I first added it, but in more
recent testing, which was some time ago, it doesn't appear to provide
any improvement.  This needs to be understood)

Also, I'd expect that the average commit time is much longer that one
jiffy on most disks, and perhaps even on fast disks and maybe even on
ramdisk.  So perhaps what's happened here is that you've increased the
sleep period and more tasks are joining particular transactions.

Or you've shortened the sleep time (which wasn't really doing anything
useful) and this causes tasks to spend less time asleep.

Or something else.
