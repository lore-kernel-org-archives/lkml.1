Of course, bouncing should only be done in one layer (the block layer).

That's another issue. The problem here are requests (cgc's) initiated by
the cdrom.c layer. Those _should_ get mapped to a request and put on the
queue for the device, and thus get bounced by the block layer if
appropriate.

Mike's fix looks legit and should be merged as well, but it wont fix
this issue.
