I have one question, didn't see this series before... Ted, what kind of
tests did you run with this and on what? Currently one has to be careful
with WRITE_SYNC, as it also implies an immediate unplug of the device.
So not only does it flag the priority as sync, it'll also kick things
off immediately. We had a nasty regression in performance in a few
revisions of the kernel due to this, sqlite performance was basically 4
times as bad as before we did WRITE_SYNC in sync_dirty_buffer(). So I'd
be curious what kind of testing was done with the patch series before
submitting it.

We should probably just dump the unplug bit from WRITE_SYNC and make
sure we do those explicitly after submission instead.

Makes some sense, but we have to be really careful with SYNC writes.
It's important that it really be things that are immediately waited upon
and not "important" writes, since otherwise it'll wreak havoc with the
responsiveness of our reads.
