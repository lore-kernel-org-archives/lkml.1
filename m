Hmm.  Perhaps the dependency conflict should go in the other direction
then.

My goal is to document the issue while a proper fix is being written.
I have known about this for all of about 1 day now.  It was added since
last time I went through the kernel and made a thorough sweep of pid users.

What the proper fix is isn't even obvious at this point.
Possibly it is making /proc/timer_stats disappear in child pid namespaces.
  Which we don't currently have the infrastructure fore.
Possibly it is reworking the stats collection so we store a struct pid *
instead of a pid_t value.  So we would know if the reader of the value
can even see processes you have collected stats for.

It is going to take a bit to digest what is going on and solve this properly.

In the same vein do we actively have interesting user space programs
using /proc/sched_debug?  It is the same class of problem.  Yet
another interface talking to user space with pids.
