I still don't see there being a need to explicitly specify the
distinction.  Why should a VMA mapping an unlinked file be any different
from a linked one?  It should point over to the 'file' checkpoint
structure and let the real work be done there.

There are no truly anonymous shared areas.  They anon ones are still
file-backed as far as the kernel is concerned.  If we do the file saving
correctly, I think most of these problems just fall out.

Either way you stack it, I think 'tag' is a horrendous variable name.
What kind of tag?  What does it do?  What does it tag?  What does it
reference?  What values are valid in there?

If we have a separate structure, we simply make it clear that the
structure will get used all over the place, and that it, too is part of
the ABI.  Knowing the sizes isn't as important as knowing that the ABI
is constant.

Exactly.  The code is copy-and-pasted.  If there's a bug in the
original, who will change this one?  Better to simply consolidate the
code into one copy.

This is where the mentality has to shift.  Instead of thinking "there is
no exact in-kernel match for what I want here" we need to consider that
we can modify the in-kernel ones.  They can be modified to suit both
existing and the new needs that we have.

Yes, but you're going to absolutely kill performance on systems which
have expensive global TLB flushes.  Frequent kmaps()s should be avoided
at all costs.

The best way around this would be to change the interface to cr_kwrite()
so that it didn't have to use *mapped* kernel memory.  Maybe an
interface that takes 'struct page'.  Or, one where we kmap_atomic() the
buffer, kunmap_atomic(), copy to a temporary buffer, then cr_kwrite().

-ENOSUP might be clearest for now.  "Your system call tried to do
something unsupported."
