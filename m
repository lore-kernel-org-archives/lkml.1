Disktest was already referenced in the beginning of the performance 
comparison thread, but its results are not very interesting if we are 
going to find out, which implementation is more effective, because in 
the modes, in which usually people run this utility, it produces latency 
insensitive workload (multiple threads working in parallel). So, such 
multithreaded disktests results will be different between STGT and SCST 
only if STGT's implementation will get target CPU bound. If CPU on the 
target is powerful enough, even extra busy loops in the STGT or SCST hot 
path code will change nothing.

Additionally, multithreaded disktest over RAM disk is a good example of 
a synthetic benchmark, which has almost no relation with real life 
workloads. But people like it, because it produces nice looking results.

Actually, I don't know what kind of conclusions it is possible to make 
from disktest's results (maybe only how throughput gets bigger or slower 
with increasing number of threads?), it's a good stress test tool, but 
not more.
