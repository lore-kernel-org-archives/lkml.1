Yeah, it works better in 2.6 (and, IIRC later 2.4 kernels).

Or, just not improved as fast as everything else is improving.
There isn't too much the kernel can do about that. It just
relatively changes the point at which you'd consider "swapping
heavily", right?

I can do this now. In make -jhuge tests for example, you can get
a 4GB, 4 core machine to max out a disk with swapping and still
have 0 idle time. Of course you can also go past that point and
your idle time comes up. That's not new though.

And if you're thrashing, then by definition you need to throw
out 1MB of your working set in order to read it in.

We had several bugs and things that caused swapping performance
regressions vs 2.4 in earlyish 2.6. After those were fixed, we're
pretty competitive with 2.4 in some basic tests I was using. I
haven't run them for a fair while, so something might have broken
since then, I don't know.
