But that's the point here.  The kernel does change a lot with each
release (you have seen the numbers, right?)  And if a change happens,
then the message also needs to change as something changed!  Why would
you think that these messages could be static till the end of time?
That's not how the kernel works.

Again, they will be unique, but again, they will change as the kernel
changes, they will have to.
