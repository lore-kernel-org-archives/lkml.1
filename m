Yes if you mean 1st as in the one after the zero-th ...

resume=/dev/sdb4
haze:~# swapon -s

dmesg snippet below...

sda is part of the /scratch xfs array though. SMART doesn't show any problems 
and of course all is well other than during a resume.

sda/b are on sata_sil (a cheap plugin pci card)

I don't think there should be activity on the sda drive during resume itself.

[I broke my / md mirror and am using some of that for swap/resume for now]

I did change the swap/resume device to sdd2 (different controller, onboard 
sata_via) and there was no EH during resume. The system seemed OK, wrote a few 
Gb of video and did a kernel compile.
I repeated this test, no EH during resume, no problems.
I even ran xfs_fsr, the defragment utility, to stress the fs.

I retain this configuration and try again tonight but it looks like there _may_ 
be a link between EH during resume and my problems...

Of course, I don't understand why it *should* EH during resume, it doesn't 
during boot or normal operation...

Any more tests you'd like me to try?

David
