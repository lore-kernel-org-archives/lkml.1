Hi Ted,

There are a few holes:

  * The process may try to handle the signal and end up blocking on
     the filesystem again.

  * The process might pass the fd to another process by forking or
     fd passing.

  * The process holding the fd might be trying to take a lock held
     by another process that is blocked on the filesystem, and infinite
     variations on that theme.

Remembering the task that did the ioctl might work out better than
remembering the fd.   Or just not try to be so fancy and rely on the
application to take appropriate measures to ensure it will not access
the filesystem, such as memlocking and not execing.

The freezer also needs to run in PF_MEMALLOC mode or similar
unless it can be sure it will not cause pageout to the frozen filesystem
under low memory conditions.

Regards,

Daniel
