The comment is misleading. I've been in the bad habit of calling
it "mmio" whenever its not DMA.

The habit is because there are two distinct enable bits in the 
pci-host bridge during error recovery: one to enable mmio/ioports, 
and the other to enable DMA. If the adapter has gone crazy, I don't 
want to enable DMA, so that it doesn't scribble to bad places. But, 
by enabling mmio/ioports, perhaps it can be finessed back into a 
semi-sane state, e.g. sane enough to perform a dump of its internal
state.
