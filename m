"accelerate its development and will broaden its developer base" is not 
about users/testers but about people doing code development.

For people wanting to try WIP code you don't need it in mainline.

Stable kernels will anyway usually contain months old code of the
WIP filesystem that is not usable for testing, so for any meaningful
testing you will still have to follow the btrfs tree and not mainline.

This is not meant as a statement on the quality of ext4 or btrfs, or any 
comparison of the development times of ext4 and btrfs, but for ext4 the 
advantages Andrew thinks would happen with an early btrfs merge do not 
seem to have happened.

I just realize that I forgot to add Ted and the ext4 mailing list into 
the Cc of my first email. Adding them to the Cc, so if I'm talking 
nonsense about the experiences with ext4 they can correct me.
