You're welcome ... although there's still a problem for modular builds.
This is what my /sys/class/bsg looks like:

So you see the if (rq->kobj.parent) is causing confusing naming.  The
reason the first one shows up as 0:0:0:0 is because in an initrd
scsi_mod is loaded first (which is when bsg binds) followed by sd_mod
(which is what gives the device the ULD binding and hence the name).  I
don't see any way around this, so I'd advocate simply using the sdev
name rather than the block device name and dumping the if.

No ... this bit's magic and clever.  Once you've set up the devices and
done a get_device, cleanup is simply doing a put_device because it's all
done in the release routine.

Thanks,
