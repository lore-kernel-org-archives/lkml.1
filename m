I see, thanks. Hmm, possibly slab becomes slower. ;)

Then I think that we need something like the ->alloc_cmd()
method. Let's ask James. 

I don't think that it's just about simply adding the hook; there are
some issues that we need to think about. Though Boaz worries too much
a bit, I think.

I'm not sure about this patch if we add ->alloc_cmd(). I doubt that
there are any llds don't use ->alloc_cmd() worry about the overhead of
the separated sense buffer allocation. If a lld doesn't define the own
alloc_cmd, then I think it's fine to use the generic command
allocator that does the separate sense buffer allocation.
