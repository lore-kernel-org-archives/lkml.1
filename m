That won't make a skerrick of difference with wsize=32K.

Try wsize=rsize=1M.

You're aware that the server screws these up again, at least for
writes?  There was a long sequence of threads on linux-nfs about this
recently, starting with

http://marc.info/?l=linux-nfs&m=121312415114958&w=2

which is Dean Hildebrand posting a patch to make the knfsd behaviour
tunable.  ToT still looks broken.  I've been using the attached patch (I
believe a similar one was posted later in the thread by Olga
Kornievskaia)  for low-latency high-bandwidth 10ge performance work,
where it doesn't help but doesn't hurt either.  It should help for your
high-latency high-bandwidth case.  Keep your tunings though, one of 
them will be affecting the TCP window scale negotiated at connect time.

That number is used to size a physically contiguous kmalloc()ed array of
slots.  With a large wsize you don't need such large slot table sizes or
large numbers of nfsds to fill the pipe.

And yes, the default number of nfsds is utterly inadequate.

There's a patch in SLES to do that, which I'd very much like to see that
in kernel.org (Neil?).  The default NFS readahead multiplier value is
pessimal and guarantees worst-case alignment of READ rpcs during
streaming reads, so we tune it from 15 to 16.
