[PATCH 0/2] Migrate data off physical pages with corrected memory errors (Version 7)

Version 7 changes:	resubmitting for 2.6.27
	page.discard.v7:
	    - Add pagemask macros in page-flags.h (per Christoph
	      Lameter's request).
	    - refreshed for linux-next

	cpe.migrate.v7:
	    - refreshed for linux-next

	page.cleanup
	    - Accepted by Linus.

Version 6 changes:
	page.cleanup.v6:
	    - Fix cut-n-paste comment (per Linus Torvalds's request).

	page.discard.v6:
	    - Fixed a problem where a page failed to migrate would end
	      up with an extra reference count (per Christoph Lameter's
	      request).
	    - Fixed comments (per Christoph Lameter's request).
	    - Moved totalbad_pages definition from mm/migrate.c to
	      arch/ia64/kernel/mca.c (per Christoph Lameter's request).

	cpe.migrate.v6:
	    - Move totalbad_pages from mm/migrate.c to ia64/kernel/mca.c.
	    - Replace tab with space (per Christoph Lameter's request).


Version 5 changes:
	page.cleanup.v5: 
	    - Change names to reflect the use and add comments to explain 
		the meaning.  (per Linus Torvalds's request).

Version 4 changes:
	page.discard.v4:
	    - Remove the hot path checks in lru_cache_add() and
		lru_cache_add_active().   Avoid moving the bad page to
		the LRU in unmap_and_move() and putback_lru_pages().
		(per Linus Torvalds's request).

	cpe.migrate.v4
	    - More code style cleanup (per Andrew Morton's request).
	    - Removed locking when calling the migration code
		(per Christoph Lameter's request).
	    - If the page fails to migrate, clear the PG_memerror flag.
	      This avoids a page with PG_memerror on the free list.

Version 3 changes:
	page.cleanup.v3: 
	    - Put PAGE_FLAGS definitions back in page-flags.h 
		(per Christoph Lameter's request).

	cpe.migrate.v3
	    - Use putback_lru_pages() when returning an individual page
		(per Christoph Lameter's request).
	    - Code style cleanup 
		(per Pekka Enberg's request).
	    - Use strict_strtoul()
		(per Pekka Enberg's request).
	    - Added locking
		(per Pekka Enberg's request).
	    - Use /sys/kernel/ instead of /proc
		(per Pekka Enberg's request).

Version 2 changes:

	Broke the page.discard patch into two patches, per request by 
	Christoph Lameter.  

	page.cleanup.v2: 
	    - minor clean-up of page flags in page_alloc.c.  

	page.discard.v2:
	    - Updated for recent page flag clean-up.
	    - Removed the change to the sysinfo struct.

	cpe.migrate.v2
	    - Added /proc/badram interface to print page discard
	      information and to free bad pages.

Purpose:

	Physical memory with corrected errors may decay over time into
	uncorrectable errors.  The purpose of this patch is to move the
	data off pages with correctable memory errors before the memory
	goes bad.

The patches:

  [1/3] page.cleanup.v6: Minor clean-up of page flags in mm/page_alloc.c

	Minor source code clean-up of page flags in mm/page_alloc.c.
	The cleanup makes it easier for the next patch to add PG_memerror.

  [2/3] page.discard.v6: Avoid putting a bad page back on the LRU.

	page.discard.v6 are the arch independent changes.  It adds a new
	page flag (PG_memerror) to mark the page as bad and avoids putting
	the page back on the LRU after migrating the data to a new page.
	The reference count on the bad page is not decremented to zero to
	avoid it being reallocated.  PG_memerror is only defined if 
	CONFIG_PAGEFLAGS_EXTENDED is defined. 

  [3/3] cpe.migrate.v6: Call migration code on correctable errors

	cpe.migrate.v6 are the IA64 specific changes.  It connects the CPE
	handler to the page migration code.  It is implemented as a kernel
	loadable module, similar to the mca recovery code (mca_recovery.ko),
	so that it can be removed to turn off the feature.  Create
	/sys/kernel/badram to print page discard information and to free
	bad pages.

Comments:

	There is always an issue of how agressive the code should be on
	migrating pages.  Should it migrate on the first correctable error,
	or wait for some threshold?  Reasonable people may disagree on the
	threshold and the "right" answer may be hardware specific.  The 
	decision making is confined to the cpe_migrate.c code and can be
	built as a kernel loadable module.  It is currently set to migrate
	on the first correctable error.

	Only pages that can be isolated on the LRU are migrated.  Other
	pages, such as compound pages, are not migrated.  That functionality
	could be a future enhancement.

	/sys/kernel/badram is a way of displaying information about the bad
	memory and freeing the bad pages.  A userspace program (or sysadmin)
	could determine if a discarded page needs to be freed.

Sample output:

	linux> insmod cpe_migrate.ko
	linux> cat /sys/kernel/badram			// This shows no discarded memory
	Bad RAM: 0 kB, 0 pages marked bad
	List of bad physical pages

	linux> ./errsingle -c 6 -s 1		// Inject correctable errors on
						// six pages.
	linux> cat /sys/kernel/badram
	Bad RAM: 384 kB, 6 pages marked bad
	List of bad physical pages
	  0x06048e10000  0x06870c40000  0x06870c20000  0x06870c10000  0x06007f00000
	  0x06042070000

	linux> echo 0x06870c20000 > /sys/kernel/badram	// Free one of the pages

	linux> cat /sys/kernel/badram			// Five pages remain on the list
	Bad RAM: 320 kB, 5 pages marked bad
	List of bad physical pages
	  0x06048e10000  0x06870c40000  0x06870c10000  0x06007f00000  0x06042070000

	linux> echo 0 > /sys/kernel/badram		// Free all the bad pages
	linux> cat /sys/kernel/badram			// All the pages are freed
	Bad RAM: 0 kB, 0 pages marked bad
	List of bad physical pages



Flow of the code description (while testing on IA64):

	1) A user level application test program allocates memory and
	   passes the virtual address of the memory to the error injection
	   driver.

	2) The error injection driver converts the virtual address to
	   physical, functions the Altix hardware to modify the ECC for the
	   physical page, creating a correctable error, and returns to the
	   user application.

	3) The user application reads the memory.

	4) The Altix hardware detects the correctable error and interrupts
	   prom.  SAL builds a CPU error record, then sends a CPE 
	   interrupt to linux.

	5) The linux CPE handler calls the cpe_migrate module (if installed).

	6) cpe_migrate parses the physical address from the CPE record and
	   adds the address to the migrate list (if not already on the list)
	   and schedules the worker thread (cpe_enable_work).

	7) cpe_enable_work calls ia64_mca_cpe_move_page.

	8) ia64_mca_cpe_move_page validates the physical address, converts
	   to page, sets PG_memerror flag and calls the migration code
	   (migrate_prep(), isolate_lru_page(), and migrate_pages().  If the
	   page migrates successfully, the bad page is added to badpagelist.

	9) Because PG_memerror is set, the bad page is not added back on the LRU
	   by avoiding calls to move_to_lru().  Avoiding move_to_lru() prevents
	   the page count from being decremented to zero.

	10) If the page fails to migrate, PG_memerror is cleared and the page 
	   returned to the LRU.  If another correctable error occurs on the
	   page another attempt will be made to migrate it.
