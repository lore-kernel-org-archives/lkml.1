If once dm-ioband is integrated into the LVM tools and bandwidth can
be assigned per device by lvcreate, the use of dm-tools is no longer
required for users.

Thank you for testing. I did the same test and here are the results.

The results are somewhat different from yours. The bandwidth is
distributed to each group equally, but CFQ priority is broken as you
said. I think that the reason is not because of FIFO, but because
some IO requests are issued from dm-ioband's kernel thread on behalf of
processes which origirante the IO requests, then CFQ assumes that the
kernel thread is the originator and uses its io_context.

The true intention of this patch is to preserve the io-context of a
process which originate it, but I think that we could also make use of
this patch for one of the way to solve this issue.

I will post the patch, but I would like to find out and understand the
reason of above test results before posting the patch.

I created those patches against 2.6.32-rc1 and made sure the patches
can be cleanly applied to that version.
