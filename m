Now that you put it that way ;)
You are right.

My asumption that "single segment" was  
equalvalent in practice with "single bvec"
does not hold true in that case.

Then, what about adding seg_boundary_mask restrictions as well?
	max_sectors = PAGE_SIZE >> 9;
	max_segments = 1;
	seg_boundary_mask = PAGE_SIZE -1;
or some such.

If adding seg_boundary_mask is still not sufficient,
lets merge that patch instead?
Why has it been dropped, respectively never been merged?
It became obsolete for dm-linear by 7bc3447b,
but in general the bug is still there, or am I missing something?
