By a few ms perhaps - nothing that you'd ever notice in real life... A 
small price to pay for the shared code. If you were to split them all 
again, the combined total size would be greater still.

Makes perfect sense to me. Just modprobe raid.o and you have all 
raid levels available. That would make a lot of sense.

That's also a way, and certainly better than just splitting out raid6.
