  Yeah, IMHO optimal would be to fault in enough buffers so that we can
fill one page (although we may pose some upper bound on the number of pages
we are willing to fault in - like 1 MB of data or so).

  Yes, that would be definitely useful. This was exceptionally easy to
track down because it was easily reproducible. But otherwise this path is
almost never taken and bugs in there are hard to debug so it would get more
testing coverage. I've spent like a month debugging a bug in reiserfs
causing data corruption in this path - mainly because it took a few days to
reproduce it and I didn't know what could be possibly triggering it...
