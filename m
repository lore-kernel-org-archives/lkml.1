Unfortunately it is insane, because the vm will barf big time on that.
Perhaps when we do the "throttle at device IO rate" for dirtying of data
we can be more relaxed, but increasing nr_requests too much will just
cause the vm to go nuts.

The pools are not big, the number is just a maximum allocation number.
In reality we only store 4 requests in the mempool, and we should
probably just dump that down to 1.
