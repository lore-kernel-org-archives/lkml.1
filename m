The gcc 4.3 inliner takes stack growth into account by default (without
any special options). I experimented a bit with it when that
was introduced and found the default thresholds are too large for the kernel 
and don't change the checkstack.pl picture much.

I asked back then and was told --param large-stack-frame
is expected to be a reasonable stable --param (as much as these can
be) and I did a patch to lower it, but I couldn't get myself
to actually submit it [if you really want it I can send it]. 

But of course that only helps for gcc 4.3+, older gccs would need
a different workaround.

On the other hand (my personal opinion, not shared by everyone) is 
that the ioctl switch stack issue is mostly only a problem with 4K 
stacks and in the rare cases when I still run 32bit kernels
I never set that option because I consider it russian roulette
(because there undoutedly dangerous dynamic stack growth cases that 
checkstack.pl doesn't flag)

Don't think the current inliner takes that into account from
a quick look at the sources, although it probably could.  
Maybe Honza can comment.

But even if it did it could only do that for a single file,
but if the function is in a different file gcc doesn't
have the information (unless you run with David's --combine hack).
This means the kernel developers have to do it anyways.

On the other hand I'm not sure it's that big a problem. Just someone
should run make checkstack occasionally and add noinlines to large
offenders.
