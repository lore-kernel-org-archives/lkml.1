greg didn't say there was _no_ kernel support.

without discussing the pros and cons of such and such implemention, full 
C/R from kernel means more maintenance work from kernel maintainers, so
it seems a good idea to leverage existing API when they exist. less work.

duplicating the get/set of the cpu state which is already done in the
signal handling is one example of extra work.

now, there's a definitely a need for kernel support for some resources. the 
question now is finding the right path, this is still work in progress IMHO.
