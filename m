After doing a quick test with your git tree, I find that I was wrong,
and task->pid is the global pid of the process, not the pid in its own
pid namespace.

So currently autofs sends a process id in the init_pid_ns.  This may
be meaningless in the autofs daemon's pid namespace, but since the
purpose is just for logging/debugging, having a global pid, which
uniquely identifies any task on the system, seems correct.

So in terms of pids no change is needed IMO.
