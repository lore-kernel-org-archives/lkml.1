Was it triggered by no free space? Later I realised that may be what happened 
when this triggered. I was writing out a large file which may filled the 
filesystem. After reboot file in question had zero size, due to journal replay I 
think, but given the amount of free space on the filesystem I think it might 
have used all space while writing out.

If this is related I will wait for -rc3 and just make sure I don't run out of 
space. :) (So far I avoided starting to build git trees etc)
