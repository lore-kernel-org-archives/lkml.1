I'm with Christoph here ... if we're going to break the backwards
compatibility of the mappings (which your code does) then we could just
dump channel and use the SCSI id and lun directly.

Understanding this code is predicated on this quirky definition in
stex_queuecommand:

	id = cmd->device->id;
	lun = cmd->device->channel; /* firmware lun issue work around */
                           ^^^^^^^

This looks to be correct, it goes up id 0 to ST_MAX_TARGET_NUM -1 then
takes the next channel.

These both look to be wrong.  You're taking the channel as the lowest
common denominator, so your first target is on channel 1 id 0, your next
on channel 2, id 0 and so on.  That's really going to mess with the
ordering (which will be user visible) is that really what you want?
