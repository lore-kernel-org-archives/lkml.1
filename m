Agreed, 100%.  Even if you fsck snapshots during slow periods, it
still doesn't help you if the filesystem gets corrupted due to a
hardware or software error.  That's where this will matter the most.

Val Hensen has done a proof of concept patch that multi-threads e2fsck
(and she's working on one that would be long-term supportable) that
might reduce the value of this patch, but metaclustering should still
help.

Also, it's not just reducing fsck times, although that's the main one.
The last time this was suggested, the rationale was to speed up the
"rm dvd.iso" case.  Also, something which *could* be done, if Abhishek
wants to pursue it, would be to pull in all of the indirect blocks
when the file is opened, and create an in-memory extent tree that
would speed up access to the file.  It's rarely worth doing this
without metaclustering, since it doesn't help for sequential I/O, only
random I/O, but with metaclustering it would also be a win for
sequential I/O.  (This would also remove the minor performance
degradation for sequential I/O imposed by metaclustering, and in fact
improve it slightly for really big files.)
