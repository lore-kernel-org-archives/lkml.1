I think one mistake we (myself included) have made all along with the barrier 
code is intermixing discussions about the cost of the solution with 
discussions about needing barriers at all.  Everyone thinks the barriers are 
slow because we also think running without barriers is mostly safe.

Barriers are actually really fast, at least when you compare them to running 
with the writecache off.  Making them faster in general may be possible, but 
they are somewhat pushed off to the side right now because so few people are 
running them.

Here's a test workload that corrupts ext3 50% of the time on power fail 
testing for me.  The machine in this test is my poor dell desktop (3ghz, dual 
core, 2GB of ram), and the power controller is me walking over and ripping 
the plug out the back.

In other words, this is not a big automated setup doing randomized power fails 
on 64 nodes over 16 hours and many TB of data.  The data working set for this 
script is 32MB, and it takes about 10 minutes per run.

 The workload has 4 parts:

1) A directory tree full of empty files with very long names (160 chars)
2) A process hogging a significant percent of system ram.  This must  be
    enough to force constant metadata writeback due to memory pressure, and is
    controlled with -p size_in_mb
3) A process constantly writing, fsyncing and truncating to zero a single 64k
    file
4) A process constantly renaming the files with very long names from (1)
    between long-named-file.0 and long-named-file.1

The idea was to simulate a loaded mailserver, and to find the corruptions by 
reading through the directory tree and finding files long-named-file.0 and 
long-named-file.1 existing at the same time.  In practice, it is faster to 
just run fsck -f on the FS after a crash.

In order to consistently cause corruptions, the size of the directory from
(1) needs to be at least as large as the ext3 log.  This is controlled with
the -s command line option.  Smaller sizes may work for the impatient, but it 
is more likely to corrupt for larger ones.

The program first creates the files in a directory called barrier-test
then it starts procs to pin ram and run the constant fsyncs.  After
each phase has run long enough, they print out a statement about
being ready, along with some other debugging output:

Memory pin ready
fsyncs ready
Renames ready

Example run:

# make 500,000 inodes on a 2GB partition.  The results in a 32MB log
mkfs.ext3 -N 500000 /dev/sda2
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
cd /mnt

# my machine has 2GB of ram, -s 1500 will pin ~1.5GB
barrier-test -s 32 -p 1500

Run init, don't cut the power yet
