Yes certainly, it's only for devices that do queuing. If they don't,
then we will always have just the one command to complete. So not much
to poll! As to pre-prep for extra latency intensive devices, have you
tried experimenting with just pretending that non-ncq devices in libata
have a queue depth of 2? That should ensure that the first command
available upon completion of the existing command is already prepped.
Not sure how much time that would save, I would hope that our prep phase
isn't too slow to begin with (or that would be the place to fix :-)

On a slow box (with many cores), the benefits are quite huge:


blocksize       blk-iopoll      IOPS    IRQ/sec         Commands/IRQ
--------------------------------------------------------------------
512b            0               25168   ~19500          1,3
512b            1               30355     ~750          40
4096b           0               25612   ~21500          1,2
4096b           1               30231    ~1200          25

I suspect there's some cache interaction going on here too, but the
numbers do look very good. On a faster box (and different architecture),
on a test that does 50k IOPS, they perform identically but the iopoll
approach uses less CPU. The interrupt rate drops from 55k ints/sec to
39-40k ints/sec for that case.

These are all synthetic IO only benchmarks, I hope to have some numbers
for some mixed benchmarks soon too.
