Bug report: regression in 2.6.27-rc1 -- scsi WRT usb-storage
Origin: Commit de72aa4c2b82a6cffe15d86a8d391ded4fb57602, "[SCSI] erase
invalid data returned by device"
Location: drivers/scsi_lib.c
Device: Secure Digital HC 4GB card in USB 2.0 card reader

Summary:
Between 2.6.26-rc9-git10 and rc9-git11, the kernel stopped properly
recognizing my USB-card-reader-mounted SDHC 4GB card.  The problem seems to
come up between usb-storage recognizing the device, and the handoff to scsi
to read the disk properties.  The bug remains in 2.6.26 and 2.6.27-rc1;
kernels before 2.6.26-rc9-git10 are unaffected.  On the same EHCI controller,
an old-spec SD 1GB card and its reader are unaffected by this bug.

The normal recognition and initialization of the device (from rc9-git9 dmesg)
goes like this:

(sde is the 1GB SD card/reader, sdf is the 4GB SDHC card/reader.)

After the bug, initialization looks the same until the device scan finishes. 
Handoff to scsi produces the following (taken from rc9-git12):

And after boot, the following set of errors recurs until device removal.
Device removal, in this case, was necessary to get LILO to update (-git12
again):

I'm not well-versed in git, so I looked through the diff between rc9-git10
and rc9-git11.  This is what looks like the offending addition:

I looked through the online git log, and it's part of commit
de72aa4c2b82a6cffe15d86a8d391ded4fb57602, under "[SCSI] erase invalid data
returned by device".  Reverting this part by itself restores the correct
handling of the device in 2.6.27-rc1.

Perhaps there's a better way to do what this patch is trying to do, because
it seems to be erasing the valid data returned by my device.  If you want me
to test out options, I'd be glad to, since I have the "offending" hardware. 
Specifics: A-Data 4GB TurboSD Class 6 SDHC card, 4GB, in a Rosewill RSD-CR102
card reader.
