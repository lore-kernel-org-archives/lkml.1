Exactly. If the data are protected you can use other software to access 
it. For ext3 an explicit ext2 mount might do it... but if you corrupt 
the underlying information, there's no going back.

In practice Linux has had lots of practice mounting garbage, and isn't 
likely to suffer terminal damage.

I wonder what happens if the device is really read-only and the o/s 
tries to replay the journal as part of a r/o mount? I suspect the system 
will refuse totally with an i/o error, not what you want.
