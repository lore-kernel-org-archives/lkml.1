I think you both are talking past each other a bit.

There is no inherent "problem with the paradigm" with regards to 
creating a userspace mkfs and userspace filesystem access library.

Yes, it's annoying to maintain two parallel codebases, but from 
experience we have found that that is what is best.  A userspace library 
is used by a wide variety of users:  specialized filesystem tools, 
filesystem repair tools, filesystem creation and optimization tools, 
FUSE implementations, the list goes on.

It has nothing to do with "block-based code boundaries".

History and experience have shown that we want a minimal, purpose-built 
filesystem in the kernel, with all the other filesystem tools external 
to the kernel.  That has proven the most robust over time, IMO (although 
noises about in-kernel fsck are beginning to appear)

I'm a bit lost in the quoting, but to respond...

One should not make assumptions that an in-kernel OSD filesystem will 
simply turn all the "inode-ish" (object manipulation) duties wholesale 
to the OSD storage device(s).  That is an implementation detail.

To conjure an example, an OSD filesystem designer may wish to store 
collections of VFS extended attributes as a single OSD object, for 
performance or caching reasons.

Or, as discussed at the filesystem/storage summit I attended, a separate 
layer handles replication and OSD device aggregation (read: RAID) just 
like MD manages RAID[0156] now.

I think that's setting the bar too high.  It would be nice if an OSD 
filesystem were user-mountable, but that obviously is less compatible 
with existing tools, admin knowledge, and site policies.

Sure.  tar/cpio/pax at the userspace level, or exofs-specific 
dump+restore tools running in userspace.  Just like with other 
filesystems :)

Let's get exofs into the kernel, and prove you wrong (or right).

I know you have wonderful anecdotes about how OSD has been around 
forever and you consider it a failed paradigm; but new work is occuring, 
and people are talking about how this might be the successor to 
sector-based devices.

Let's not be closed-minded and close doors before they can be opened.

At this point, OSD is a fun and interesting research experiment that 
might have promise for the future.

That's Linux's bread-n-butter:  be on the cutting edge, experimenting 
with new technologies.  Some pan out, others don't.

But I don't see any compelling reason for an overall pushback _against_ 
OSD devices and filesystems.

Are you somehow assuming that existing block-based filesystems will take 
advantage of OSD?  I hope not; that would be silly.

_Of course_ using OSD implies a new filesystem.  You are using a wholly 
different method of interacting with storage.

Just like NFS implies a new filesystem, because networked RPC is wholly 
different from sector-based storage as well.

If having a compelling user case was a prereq for kernel inclusion, well 
over half the code would be gone.

It is fantasy to think we will be migrating ext4 to OSD.  That fantasy 
is not a compelling reason to block OSD development.

To sum,

* exofs needs a userspace library, around which the standard filesystem 
tools will be built, most notably mkfs, dump, restore, fsck

* talk of migrating existing filesystems is wildly premature (and a bit 
of a silly argument, since you are also arguing that OSD lacks 
compelling use cases)

* an in-kernel OSD-based filesystem needs some sort of generic in-kernel 
libosd API, so that multiple OSD filesystems do not reinvent the wheel 
each time.

* OSD was bound to be annoying, because it forces the kernel filesystem 
to either (a) talk SCSI or (b) use messages that can be converted to 
SCSI OSD commands, like existing drivers convert the block layer's READ 
and WRITE to device-specific commands.

* Trying to force OSD to export a block device is pushing a square peg 
through a round hole.  Thus, the best (and only) alternative is 
character device.  What you really want is a Third Way(tm):  a mmap'able 
message device, since you really want to export an API to userspace.
