Currently the XFS freezer doesn't solve a deadlock automatically
and we rely on administrators for ensuring that the freezer will not
access the filesystem.
And even if the wrong freezer causes a deadlock, it can be solved
by other unfreeze process(unfreeze command).

So I don't think the freezer itself needs to solve the deadlock.
I think the timeout is effective for a unexpected deadlock
and the timeout extending feature is very useful
as Dmitri proposed.

Cheers, Takashi
