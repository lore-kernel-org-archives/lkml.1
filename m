I've looked at a few alternative options: scanning for NULLs,
NULL-terminating in nd_set_link, NULL-terminating in the FS code
(where it is necessary and not already being done), and passing the
length around explicitly.

NULL-terminating is definitely cleaner and easier than scanning.
Unfortunately, as Christoph indicated, passing the length around
explicitly does rather complicate the code. So the question is whether
to NULL-terminate in nd_set_link or earlier in the FS code.

Having tried both options, I'm inclined to do it in the FS code and
leave nd_set_link as it is. Many of the filesystems already take pains
to ensure the links are NULL-terminated and the minimal change of
fixing the others seems the safest option. However, this way we won't
solve things for all filesystems for all time, as Andrew wanted. I'll
post my preferred patches shortly, but if anyone would like to see
what the full nd_set_link change would look like let me know and I'll
post them for comparison.

FYI, here are the diffstats for the two options:
