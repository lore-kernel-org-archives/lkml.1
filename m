Indeed, the above I still find to be true. The only real case where
larger depths make a real difference, is a pure random reads (or writes,
with write caching off) workload. And those situations are largely
synthetic, hence benchmarks tend to show NCQ being a lot more beneficial
since they construct workloads that consist 100% of random IO. Real life
is rarely so black and white.

Additionally, there are cases where drive queue depths hurt a lot. The
drive has no knowledge of fairness, or process-to-io mappings. So AS/CFQ
has to artificially limit queue depths competing IO processes doing
semi (or fully) sequential workloads, or throughput plummets.

So while NCQ has some benefits, I typically tend to prefer managing the
IO queue largely in software instead of punting to (often) buggy
firmware.
