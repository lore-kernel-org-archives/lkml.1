Sorry, but I'm not seeing enough solid justification here for merging a
fairly large amount of fairly tricksy code into core kernel.  Code
which, afaict, is heading in the opposite direction from where we've
all been going for a year or two.

What are the alternatives here?  What do we need to do to make
throttling a per-memcg thing?


The patchset is badly misnamed, btw.  It doesn't throttle writeback -
in fact several people are working on IO bandwidth controllers and
calling this thing "writeback throttling" risks confusion.

What we're in fact throttling is rate-of-memory-dirtying.  The last
thing we want to throttle is writeback - we want it to go as fast as
possible!

Only I can't think of a suitable handy-dandy moniker for this concept.
