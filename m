Yeap, it's a purely ATA specific workaround.

Now I remembered what was the problem.  The problem was that the
latest hook libata can use is ->slave_configure which is called before
HLD attaches, so there's no sdkp or genhd associated during libata
configuration.  Longer term, this definitely is something which should
be stripped out of SCSI whether that happens with ATA HLD on top of
SCSI or a completely separate stack.  Any better ideas on how to work
around this for now?

Thanks.
