Thanks ... it looks like we may have trouble from devices that alter the
unchecked isa dma flag after scsi_host_alloc.  The guilty parties appear
to be gdth, eata, u14-34f, ultrastor, BusLogic and advansys.

The trouble is that if you alloc the host with it one way and free it
with it the other, the wrong freelist is used and the ref counts are
invalid.

Try this pseudo fix: it avoids allocating the freelist until add time
(by which time they should all have fixed the flag).  It still doesn't
change the fact that the host is allocated in the wrong region, but that
shouldn't matter too much.
