This paragraph, while accurate, is unrelated to the contents of this
patch. Note that in an asm(), a "memory" clobber (see barrier()) is
not at all the same thing as a memory operand "m"(...), which is what
we're using here. Just drop this bit.

You've edited my comments and put them together in a way that doesn't
quite make sense. In particular, "This works" doesn't refer to the
previous text but the local-struct-of-variable-size trick. The text
should read something like:

To prevent a memset() from being eliminated, the compiler must belive
that the memory area is used after the memset(). Also, every byte in
the memory area must be used. If only the first byte is used, via e.g.
asm("" :: "m"(*(char*)p)), then the compiler _will_ skip scrubbing
bytes beyond the first.

The trick is to define a local type of the same size as the memory
area, and use it for the "m" operand in a dummy asm():

	static inline void fake_memory_use(void *p, size_t n)
	{
		struct __scrub { char c[n]; }
		asm("" : : "m"(*(struct __scrub *)p));
	}

This looks strange, n being a variable, but has been confirmed to
work with gcc-3.2.3 up to gcc-4.4.3.

1. This doesn't need to be a macro. Please make it a static inline function.
2. Its function is to "fake" a use of a memory area, which allows us to prevent
   unwanted DSE elsewhere. So this should be fake_memory_use() or something.

The typeof(*p) suggestion doesn't work. It would require p to always be
a pointer type with an accurate (for memset) sizeof(*p). In general however
we'll memset some array described by a void*/size_t pair, and typeof in
that case is useless. The original'struct __scrub { char c[n]; };' was Ok.

Why is this __kernel_size_t and not just plain size_t? It's not
a user-space API.
