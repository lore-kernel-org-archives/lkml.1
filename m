You're the one who keeps suggesting migration, not me.  I keep
suggesting ways to make OSD more relevant to current user problems.

A maintainer doesn't have to like everything they merge.

Um, speaking with my business hat on, I'd really beg to differ ... you
don't release a product into an empty market.  you pick an existing one,
or fill a fundamental need that a market nucleates around.  If that
means block based filesystems hacked to work with OSDs, I think they'd
take it, yes.

Well, that was the idea, with OSD version 1.  The problem is that the
benchmarks didn't confirm that letting the disk take care of object
placement was a win over block based filesystems.   If you want to
migrate objects across disks (i.e. cfs paradigm), then it is a win, but
not really for performance.  That's why OSDv2 has been beefing up
attributes and security.

The interesting question is what does it take to allow arbitrary
filesystems to benefit from this.

Because writing a new filesystem is so much easier?

That's a possibility ... as I said before: a block device with extra
features that allows incremental use in the filesystem.

So what's your proposal for lowering the barrier to adoption then?

It's relevant to lowering the barrier to adoption, unless there's some
other means I haven't seen.

Filesystems are complex and difficult beasts to get right.  Btrfs took a
year to get to the point of kernel inclusion and will take some little
time longer to get enterprises to the point of trusting data to it.  So
if we say a two year lead time, that would mean that even if someone
started a general purpose OSD based filesystem today, it wouldn't be
ready for the consumer market until 2011.  That's not really going to
convince the disk vendors that OSD based devices should be marketed
today.
