Technically, it's not a regression.  The MSI problem has always been
there, it was just exposed when the SAS card switched to using MSI by
default.  It's fixed by the bridge quirk  ... of course it's unclear how
many more bridges with problems there are.

No ... it's a separate issue.  MSI was enabled for fusion SAS in 2.6.26;
the problem msi patch which the above corrects actually has the effect
of disabling MSI for fusion and went into 2.6.29-rc2, which isn't a
kernel that's been tested here.

Yes, they've been a bit unresponsive.   I'm not unhappy with the current
situation, since MSI is globally disabled for fusion at the moment (so
we shouldn't get any more MSI problem reports), so I'm happy to wait and
see what they want to do.
