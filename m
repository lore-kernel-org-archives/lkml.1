Mea culpa.  I looked but did not see.  I have tested your patch.  It
does solve my problem.  I've attached my version, with comments as you
suggested, below.

I have added get_device()/put_device() to ensure there's the device
hasn't fully disappeared before calling list_del_init().  Is this
needed?  If so, there's "might_sleep()" commented out in put_device().
Do I need to release the lock before calling put_device()?

Thanks for you patience.

Hugh
