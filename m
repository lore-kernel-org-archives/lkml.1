IBM is not working on OSD for a long time now. We at open-osd are.
That is me and Benny (abit) and other people that hang on the mailing-list
So it is mostly Panasas these days.

On git.open-osd.org we are hosting various OSD projects mainly the submitted

One of the projects on open-osd.org is the OSC's osd-target which is based
on scsi tgt framework and implements an OSD in user-mode over any local
filesystem. It supports any SCSI transport supported by tgt that is: iscsi,
fcoe, iser, kernel-tgt. This is what we test against. I have just been porting
that project to freebsd. It as a very small foot print compared to, lets say NFS.
