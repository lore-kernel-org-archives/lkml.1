Very well. I've reset the for-linus branch with just the NFS development
changes (see below).

I'll let David take care of the cachefs merge (which I obviously ack).

I'll resend the mount patches in a later mail series after I've fixed up
Al's objection.

For now, please pull from the "for-linus" branch of the repository at

   git pull git://git.linux-nfs.org/projects/trondmy/nfs-2.6.git for-linus

This will update the following files through the appended changesets.

    NFS: Start PF_INET6 callback listener only if IPv6 support is available
    
    Apparently a lot of people need to disable IPv6 completely on their
    distributor-built systems, which have CONFIG_IPV6_MODULE enabled at
    build time.
    
    They do this by blacklisting the ipv6.ko module.  This causes the
    creation of the NFSv4 callback service listener to fail if
    CONFIG_IPV6_MODULE is set, but the module cannot be loaded.
    
    Now that the kernel's PF_INET6 RPC listeners are completely separate
    from PF_INET listeners, we can always start PF_INET.  Then the NFS
    client can try to start a PF_INET6 listener, but it isn't required
    to be available.

    SUNRPC: Simplify kernel RPC service registration
    
    The kernel registers RPC services with the local portmapper with an
    rpcbind SET upcall to the local portmapper.  Traditionally, this used
    rpcbind v2 (PMAP), but registering RPC services that support IPv6
    requires rpcbind v3 or v4.
    
    Since we now want separate PF_INET and PF_INET6 listeners for each
    kernel RPC service, svc_register() will do only one of those
    registrations at a time.
    
    For PF_INET, it tries an rpcb v4 SET upcall first; if that fails, it
    does a legacy portmap SET.  This makes it entirely backwards
    compatible with legacy user space, but allows a proper v4 SET to be
    used if rpcbind is available.
    
    For PF_INET6, it does an rpcb v4 SET upcall.  If that fails, it fails
    the registration, and thus the transport creation.  This let's the
    kernel detect if user space is able to support IPv6 RPC services, and
    thus whether it should maintain a PF_INET6 listener for each service
    at all.
    
    This provides complete backwards compatibilty with legacy user space
    that only supports rpcbind v2.  The only down-side is that registering
    a new kernel RPC service may take an extra exchange with the local
    portmapper on legacy systems, but this is an infrequent operation and
    is done over UDP (no lingering sockets in TIMEWAIT), so it shouldn't
    be consequential.

    SUNRPC: Simplify svc_unregister()
    
    Our initial implementation of svc_unregister() assumed that PMAP_UNSET
    cleared all rpcbind registrations for a [program, version] tuple.
    However, we now have evidence that PMAP_UNSET clears only "inet"
    entries, and not "inet6" entries, in the rpcbind database.
    
    For backwards compatibility with the legacy portmapper, the
    svc_unregister() function also must work if user space doesn't support
    rpcbind version 4 at all.
    
    Thus we'll send an rpcbind v4 UNSET, and if that fails, we'll send a
    PMAP_UNSET.
    
    This simplifies the code in svc_unregister() and provides better
    backwards compatibility with legacy user space that does not support
    rpcbind version 4.  We can get rid of the conditional compilation in
    here as well.

    SUNRPC: Allow callers to pass rpcb_v4_register a NULL address
    
    The user space TI-RPC library uses an empty string for the universal
    address when unregistering all target addresses for [program, version].
    The kernel's rpcb client should behave the same way.
    
    Here, we are switching between several registration methods based on
    the protocol family of the incoming address.  Rename the other rpcbind
    v4 registration functions to make it clear that they, as well, are
    switched on protocol family.  In /etc/netconfig, this is either "inet"
    or "inet6".
    
    NB: The loopback protocol families are not supported in the kernel.

    SUNRPC: rpcbind actually interprets r_owner string
    
    RFC 1833 has little to say about the contents of r_owner; it only
    specifies that it is a string, and states that it is used to control
    who can UNSET an entry.
    
    Our port of rpcbind (from Sun) assumes this string contains a numeric
    UID value, not alphabetical or symbolic characters, but checks this
    value only for AF_LOCAL RPCB_SET or RPCB_UNSET requests.  In all other
    cases, rpcbind ignores the contents of the r_owner string.
    
    The reference user space implementation of rpcb_set(3) uses a numeric
    UID for all SET/UNSET requests (even via the network) and an empty
    string for all other requests.  We emulate that behavior here to
    maintain bug-for-bug compatibility.

    SUNRPC: Use IPv4 loopback for registering AF_INET6 kernel RPC services
    
    The kernel uses an IPv6 loopback address when registering its AF_INET6
    RPC services so that it can tell whether the local portmapper is
    actually IPv6-enabled.
    
    Since the legacy portmapper doesn't listen on IPv6, however, this
    causes a long timeout on older systems if the kernel happens to try
    creating and registering an AF_INET6 RPC service.  Originally I wanted
    to use a connected transport (either TCP or connected UDP) so that the
    upcall would fail immediately if the portmapper wasn't listening on
    IPv6, but we never agreed on what transport to use.
    
    In the end, it's of little consequence to the kernel whether the local
    portmapper is listening on IPv6.  It's only important whether the
    portmapper supports rpcbind v4.  And the kernel can't tell that at all
    if it is sending requests via IPv6 -- the portmapper will just ignore
    them.
    
    So, send both rpcbind v2 and v4 SET/UNSET requests via IPv4 loopback
    to maintain better backwards compatibility between new kernels and
    legacy user space, and prevent multi-second hangs in some cases when
    the kernel attempts to register RPC services.

    We're about to convert over to using separate PF_INET and PF_INET6

    SUNRPC: Remove @family argument from svc_create() and svc_create_pooled()
    
    Since an RPC service listener's protocol family is specified now via
    svc_create_xprt(), it no longer needs to be passed to svc_create() or
    svc_create_pooled().  Remove that argument from the synopsis of those
    functions, and remove the sv_family field from the svc_serv struct.

    SUNRPC: Pass a family argument to svc_register()
    
    The sv_family field is going away.  Instead of using sv_family, have
    the svc_register() function take a protocol family argument.
    
    Since this argument represents a protocol family, and not an address
    family, this argument takes an int, as this is what is passed to
    sock_create_kern().  Also make sure svc_register's helpers are
    checking for PF_FOO instead of AF_FOO.  The value of [AP]F_FOO are
    equivalent; this is simply a symbolic change to reflect the semantics
    of the value stored in that variable.
    
    sock_create_kern() should return EPFNOSUPPORT if the passed-in
    protocol family isn't supported, but it uses EAFNOSUPPORT for this
    case.  We will stick with that tradition here, as svc_register()
    is called by the RPC server in the same path as sock_create_kern().

    SUNRPC: Don't flag empty RPCB_GETADDR reply as bogus
    
    In 2007, commit e65fe3976f594603ed7b1b4a99d3e9b867f573ea added
    additional sanity checking to rpcb_decode_getaddr() to make sure we
    were getting a reply that was long enough to be an actual universal
    address.  If the uaddr string isn't long enough, the XDR decoder
    returns EIO.
    
    However, an empty string is a valid RPCB_GETADDR response if the
    requested service isn't registered.  Moreover, "::.n.m" is also a
    valid RPCB_GETADDR response for IPv6 addresses that is shorter
    than rpcb_decode_getaddr()'s lower limit of 11.  So this sanity
    check introduced a regression for rpcbind requests against IPv6
    remotes.
    
    So revert the lower bound check added by commit
    e65fe3976f594603ed7b1b4a99d3e9b867f573ea, and add an explicit check
    for an empty uaddr string, similar to libtirpc's rpcb_getaddr(3).

    SUNRPC: Add the equivalent of the linger and linger2 timeouts to RPC sockets
    
    This fixes a regression against FreeBSD servers as reported by Tomas
    Kasparek. Apparently when using RPC over a TCP socket, the FreeBSD servers
    don't ever react to the client closing the socket, and so commit
    e06799f958bf7f9f8fae15f0c6f519953fb0257c (SUNRPC: Use shutdown() instead of
    close() when disconnecting a TCP socket) causes the setup to hang forever
    whenever the client attempts to close and then reconnect.
    
    We break the deadlock by adding a 'linger2' style timeout to the socket,
    after which, the client will abort the connection using a TCP 'RST'.
    
    The default timeout is set to 15 seconds. A subsequent patch will put it
    under user control by means of a systctl.

    NFS: Throttle page dirtying while we're flushing to disk
    
    The following patch is a combination of a patch by myself and Peter
    Staubach.
    
    Trond: If we allow other processes to dirty pages while a process is doing
    a consistency sync to disk, we can end up never making progress.
    
    Peter: Attached is a patch which addresses a continuing problem with
    the NFS client generating out of order WRITE requests.  While
    this is compliant with all of the current protocol
    specifications, there are servers in the market which can not
    handle out of order WRITE requests very well.  Also, this may
    lead to sub-optimal block allocations in the underlying file
    system on the server.  This may cause the read throughputs to
    be reduced when reading the file from the server.
    
    Peter: There has been a lot of work recently done to address out of
    order issues on a systemic level.  However, the NFS client is
    still susceptible to the problem.  Out of order WRITE
    requests can occur when pdflush is in the middle of writing
    out pages while the process dirtying the pages calls
    generic_file_buffered_write which calls
    generic_perform_write which calls
    balance_dirty_pages_rate_limited which ends up calling
    writeback_inodes which ends up calling back into the NFS
    client to writes out dirty pages for the same file that
    pdflush happens to be working with.

    NFSv4: Simplify some cache consistency post-op GETATTRs
    
    Certain asynchronous operations such as write() do not expect
    (or care) that other metadata such as the file owner, mode, acls, ...
    change. All they want to do is update and/or check the change attribute,
    ctime, and mtime.
    By skipping the file owner and group update, we also avoid having to do a
    potential idmapper upcall for these asynchronous RPC calls.

    NFS: Fix the type of struct nfs_fattr->mode
    
    There is no point in using anything other than umode_t, since we copy the

    NFSv4: Support NFSv4 optional attributes in the struct nfs_fattr
    
    Currently, filling struct nfs_fattr is more or less an all or nothing
    operation, since NFSv2 and NFSv3 have only mandatory attributes.
    In NFSv4, some attributes are optional, and so we may simply not be able to
    fill in those fields. Furthermore, NFSv4 allows you to specify which
    attributes you are interested in retrieving, thus permitting you to
    optimise away retrieval of attributes that you know will no change...

    NFS: flush cached directory information slightly more readily.
    
    If cached directory contents becomes incorrect, there is no way to
    flush the contents.  This contrasts with files where file locking is
    the recommended way to ensure cache consistency between multiple
    applications (a read-lock always flushes the cache).
    
    Also while changes to files often change the size of the file (thus
    triggering a cache flush), changes to directories often do not change
    the apparent size (as the size is often rounded to a block size).
    
    So it is particularly important with directories to avoid the
    possibility of an incorrect cache wherever possible.
    
    When the link count on a directory changes it implies a change in the
    number of child directories, and so a change in the contents of this
    directory.  So use that as a trigger to flush cached contents.
    
    When the ctime changes but the mtime does not, there are two possible
    reasons.
     1/ The owner/mode information has been changed.
     2/ utimes has been used to set the mtime backwards.
    
    In the first case, a data-cache flush is not required.
    In the second case it is.
    
    So on the basis that correctness trumps performance, flush the
    directory contents cache in this case also.

    SUNRPC: Avoid spurious wake-up during UDP connect processing
    
    To clear out old state, the UDP connect workers unconditionally invoke
    xs_close() before proceeding with a new connect.  Nowadays this causes
    a spurious wake-up of the task waiting for the connect to complete.
    
    This is a little racey, but usually harmless.  The waiting task
    immediately retries the connect via a call_bind/call_connect sequence,
    which usually finds the transport already in the connected state
    because the connect worker has finished in the background.
    
    To avoid a spurious wake-up, factor the xs_close() logic that resets
    the underlying socket into a helper, and have the UDP connect workers
    call that helper instead of xs_close().
