Two problems with what you just described:

1) "value indicates current event state" is a new concept in this thread 
(maybe you were thinking this all along, but I didn't get that from your 
writing).

Watching the sysfs node for event activity is definitely outside the 
scope of this work, and IMO not very useful.  The time from when LLDD 
calls sdev_evt_notify() until uevent completion is very short, so the 
time window for actually receiving a useful value in your scenario is 
also short.

My patch presented the attributes purely as control nodes, only affected 
sdev->supported_events and nothing more.  You seem to be suggesting 
exporting the true-for-only-a-few-milliseconds activity state, rather 
then enable/disable state.


2) Event support itself is dynamic, which causes me to revisit the 
"complexity" argument.  In libata, for example, we only note that the 
media-change event is supported after some time passes -- not in the 
initial slave_config.  Or error handler may disable it at runtime 
because that event is problematic.

As such, that implies that the LLDD (with help from scsi_lib) is 
dynamically adding and removing these attributes at runtime -- a lot 
more complexity than is really needed AFAICS.

It is easy and straightforward for the driver to set a bit.

We cannot assume the state of event support bits are constant from 
modprobe/slave_config time.
