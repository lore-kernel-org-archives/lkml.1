Yes there are only two users of time interpolators. The generic 
gettimeofday work by John Stultz will make time interpolators obsolete 
soon. I already saw a patch to remove them.

Right.

Booting with nojitter is the easiest way to solve this if one is willing 
to accept slightly inaccurate clocks.

Interesting solution. But there may be multiple updates of last happening. 
Which of the winners is the real winner?

Our SGI machines have their own clock that is hardware replicated to all 
nodes.

This would certainly a nice improvement for SMP machines. It certainly 
works nicely for 2 way systems.
