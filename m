That actually causes an interesting problem for compressing filesystems.
The space consumed by blocks depends on their contents and how well it
compresses.  At the moment, the only option I see to support
posix_fallocate for LogFS is to set an inode flag disabling compression,
then allocate the blocks.

But if the file already contains large amounts of compressed data, I
have a problem.  Disabling compression for a range within a file is not
supported, so I can only return an error.  But which one?
