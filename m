Perhaps, I haven't tracked down exactly what the difference in behavior
between working 2.6.29 and broken 2.6.30-rc2 is.  It seems like the disk
spins up more often (in response to hal background probes presumably)
with 30-rc2 than it did before, and running "udevadm monitor" I do see
the following repeated "change" events happening, even on an idle
system:

I've verified that O_EXCL works at least with a trivial test program, so
it's not simply that EXCL broke.

Also I've verified with strace that hald-addon-storage and wodim are
both using O_EXCL, and that hald-addon-storage gets EBUSY while wodim is
writing the disk.  (The straced run didn't fail, unfortunately.)
