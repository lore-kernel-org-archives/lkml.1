Not really.  The commit needs to be sent, but the writes are still
asynchronous.  It's just that the pages can't be recycled until they are
on stable storage.

Commits and writes on the same inode need to be serialized for
consistency (write can change the data and metadata; commit [fsync]
needs to provide guarantees that the written data are stable). The
performance problem arises because NFS writes are fast (they generally
just deposit data into the server's page cache), but commits can take a
long time, especially if there is a lot of cached data to flush to
stable storage.

Not with the eager writeback patch.  The nr_writeback for NFS is limited
by the woutstanding tunable parameter multiplied by the number of active
NFS files being written.

What affects user-visible responsiveness is avoiding long delays and
avoiding delays that vary widely.  Whether the limit is global or
per-file is less important (but I'd be happy to be convinced otherwise).
