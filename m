Having the RPC client throw -EIO on a timeout always seemed a little  
crude to me.  EIO is quite overloaded -- the same error is returned  
if there's a XDR decoding error, for example.  Clearly other  
consumers of RPC (mount, for example) would like a distinction  
between a timeout and an outright I/O error.

The fact that applications using NFS files can't deal with -ETIMEDOUT  
should probably be managed in the NFS client, not in the RPC client.   
Perhaps it could be handled with a wrapper function, like the NFS  
client handles EJUKEBOX.

So I agree that Jeff's patch is insufficient as it stands, but the  
underlying idea is probably a good one.

That's not a bad idea either.
