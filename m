Ah... Now I think I see... We can provide an initial counter w/o a
problem, but counter incrementation is implementation-specific, so
we can't have automated tests that cover multiple enc/dec ops, but
if we limit ourselves to just one op, self-tests should be perfectly
doable, and NIST SP 800-38A, Appendix F.5 has vectors we could make
use of (using just the block #1 values). At least, spot-checking
the vectors, I'm getting the expected results for the 1st block.

Okay, I'll whip something up in a sec.
