I guess you mean the close-to-open cache consistency? If so, this
problem doesn't actually break that. The actual nfs_file_open call does
occur even when you're opening by following one of these symlinks. I
believe the cache consistency code occurs there.

The problem here is really nfsv4 specific. There the on-the-wire open
call and initialization of state actually happens during d_lookup and
d_revalidate. Neither of these happens with these LAST_BIND symlinks so
we end up with a filp that has no NFSv4 state attached.

Well, these LAST_BIND symlinks return a real dget'ed dentry today. If
we assume that it always returns a valid dentry (which seems to be the
case), then I suppose it's OK to do a d_revalidate against it.

It's possible though that that revalidate will either fail though or
return that it's no good. In that case, this code just returns ESTALE
which should make the path walking code revalidate all the way up the
chain. That should (hopefully) make whatever syscall we're servicing
return an error.

Thanks for the review so far.
