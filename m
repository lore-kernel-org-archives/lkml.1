dma_capable() doesn't work for Xen in the way that Ian hopes.

As I said to him again and again, he tries to use arch code in the
very original way, and it's unacceptable (of course, he disagreed with
it).

I don't think that we need to take account of dom0 support; we don't
have a clear idea about an acceptable dom0 design (it needs to use
swiotlb code? I don't know yet), we don't even know we will have dom0
support in mainline. That's why I didn't CC this patchset to Xen
camp.

I think that it's more reasonable to think about how the code can
works for dom0 support when Xen people come with the new dom0 code.
