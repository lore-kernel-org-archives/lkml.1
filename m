prep_rq_fn is called very, very late -- from elv_next_request(), which 
is called from ->request_fn.

As quoted above, I'm talking about something closer to -creation- time, 
not -execution- time.

Sure, because that's further down the pipeline at the request execution 
stage.  Think more like make_request time...

Makes sense...
