The complexity is the same imho, both versions are fairly trivial.
I wasn't out to optimize this in a memory copy sense. To me the most
precious resource is the data stream to the app, and 128 bytes
is probably 6 times larger than the normal message would be. With
the actual trace structure, we are down to about 3 times the byte
size.

So it was just an idea, I don't care much either way. With 128 bytes,
we could just put the buffer on the stack (and still do the copy to
the relay buffer). The per-cpu buffers has the advantage that we
could grow the size easily if we wanted to.

So, given everything, which do you prefer?
