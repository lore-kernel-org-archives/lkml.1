I think so, but I may not understand what you mean correctly.
So please elaborate your concern if my explanation below doesn't
satisfy what you want to know.

bdi_lld_congested() also does that using bdi_congested(), which calls
->congested_fn().
And only real device drivers (e.g. scsi, ide) set/clear the flag.
Stacking drivers like request-based dm don't.
So stacking drivers always check the BDI_lld_congested flag of
the bottom device of the device stack.

BDI_[write|read]_congested flags have been using for queue's
congestion, so that I/O queueing/merging can be proceeded even if
the lld is congested.  So I added a new flag.

Do you mean that "a single backing_dev via two disks/controllers" is
a dm device (e.g. a dm-multipath device having 2 paths, a dm-mirror
device having 2 disks)?

If so, dm doesn't set/clear the flag, and the decision, whether
the dm device itself is congested or not, depends on dm's target driver.

For example of dm-multipath,
  o call bdi_lld_congested() for each path.
  o if one of the paths are uncongested, dm-multipath will decide
    the dm device is uncongested and dispatch incoming I/Os to
    the uncongested path.

For example of dm-mirror,
  o call bdi_lld_congested() for each disk.
  o if the incoming I/O is READ, same logic as dm-multipath above.
    if the incoming I/O is WRITE, dm-mirror will decide the dm device
    is uncongested only when all disks are uncongested.
