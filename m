It shouldn't ... the two inputs should be longs and the sizeof should be
dividing by a constant size_t.  __udivdi3 is used for 64 bit division on
a 32 bit platform, so where's it getting the idea that something in the
division is 64 bit?

The culprit looks to be

    x86: asm/io.h: unify virt_to_phys/phys_to_virt

Because it changed the return of virt_to_phys from long to phys_addr_t
which is unsigned long long on a PAE platform, which this is.

So, I could suggest a fix below since isa addresses may never be above
32 bits, but I think this issue has more ramifications for the other
legacy users of virt_to_phys.
