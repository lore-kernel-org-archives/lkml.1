You mean an sshd with an open connection probably; the server itself
is clearly useful to be able to c/r.

A canonical example would a virtual-private-server: instead of doing
server consolidation with a virtual machine, your do with containers.
In a sense, containers lets you chop the OS into independent isolated
pieces. You ca use a linux box to run multiple virtual execution
environments (containers), each running services of your choice. They
could range from a sshd for users, to apache servers, to database
servers to users' vnc sessions, etc.

Now comes the that you really need to take the machine down, for
whatever reason. With c/r of live connections you can live-migrate
these containers to another machine (on the same subnet) that will
"steal" the IP as well, and voila - no service disruption.

Such scenarios are the focus of Alexey.

I'm also very interested in these scenarios, and I'm _also_ thinking
of other scenarios, where either (a) an entire container is not
necessary (example: user running long computation on laptop and wants
to save it before a reboot), or (b) the program would like to make
adjustments to its state compared to the time it was saved (example:
change the location of an output log file depending on the machine
on which your are running).

Unfortunately, if we plan for and require, as per Alexey, that c/r
would only work for whole-containers, these two cases will not be
addressed.
