This is completely another problem we have to solve.
The CFQ scheduler has really bad assumption that the current process
must be the owner. This problem occurs when you use some of device
mapper devices or use linux aio.

Actually, I already have a patch to solve this problem, which make
each bio have a pointer to the io_context of the owner process.
Would you take a look at the thread whose subject is "I/O context
inheritance" in:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0804.2/index.html#2850

Fernando also knows this.

Thank you,
Hirokazu Takahashi.
