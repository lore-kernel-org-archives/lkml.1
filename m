Four and eight port LSI cards:

Firmware and BIOS for both Integrated RAID and Initiator-Target.  Must 
boot to DOS to run utility.  Batch file simplifies installation.

Welcome to LSI Logic Integrated SAS Flash Utility
      This Utility will upgrade your LSI SAS3442E HBA

      Integrated RAID ( IR ) or Initiator ( IT ) Firmware

     For IR     Type   R or r
     For IT     Type   T or t
     To Exit    Type   q

So one just needs to flash the card and use the initiator firmware and 
then it will act like a regular (SAS) HBA, no RAID in the card itself, and 
then one, presumably could use the card for md/software raid and have 
direct access to the disks, no need for exporting disks via JBOD etc?

Justin.
