James,
Another aspect, especially if a large amount of storage
is to be trimmed, is how long will it take? This relates
to the timeout value we should associate with such an
invocation. The FORMAT UNIT and START STOP UNIT commands
have an IMMED bit, but not WRITE SAME.

Speaking of FORMAT UNIT, some words were added into sbc3r18
that suggest a FORMAT UNIT command could be interpreted as
unmap/trim the whole disk.
