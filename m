No, but it dramatically reduces that value of being able to enumerate
those devices.

Breaking old behaviour is always bad... My computers with IDE
interfaces still see stable "/dev/hda" devices.  Are you saying the
devices that used to be "hda" are now "sdb" ??  Maybe there is a
.config option...

Depends on your metric.

"Easy to type" - I guess /dev/hda1 wins hands down.
"Can be used in a script or config file and is guaranteed always to
work until a screwdriver is used to change that device or it's
controller"
  I think
      /dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-0:0:0:0-part1
is quite acceptable.
What is your metric?

My definition of "the large majority or uses" is "mkfs, fsck, mount,
fdisk, system-install-process".

Different people differentiate devices in different ways.  A system
integrator might know about the hardware path.  An end user might know
about drive brands or sizes.  A casual user might just think "internal
or external".  The kernel cannot support all these different
approaches to naming.  It really is best if it uses arbitrary names,
and provides access to descriptions that the user can choose between.
udev facilitates this with links in /dev/disk/.  A system install can
facilitate this even more by reporting size/manufacturer information etc.

I'm guessing you are talking about mount-by-uuid? This effectively has
to look at the filesystem of all devices to discover which one has the
correct UUID, though it can cache the information for efficiency.

Maybe it is just an implementation issue.  Suppose that everytime a
device were discovered, it were examined to see what was stored on it,
and this information was stored in a cache.
Then to find a particular filesystem to mount, you just look in the
cache and if the info isn't there yet, just wait or fail as
appropriate. 
Then we don't "look at my USB devices to find my SATA hard drive" but
rather "look at each device as it is attached to find out what is in
it", which seems like a sensible thing to do...

I think your "laptops vs big iron" contrast is making the gap seem
bigger than it really is.  Naming issues are present in laptops and
easily get significant is modest servers.

Funny you should suggest that...
I don't think OpenSuSE10.3 includes any UP kernels.  There is code in
the kernel which detects the single processor case and removes some
the more expense "LOCK" operations to reduce the cost of using an SMP
kernel on a UP computer.
There is real value in reducing the number of options, and people have
obviously put work into making that a cost-effective proposition.
