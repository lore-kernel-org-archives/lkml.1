Ok, can you suggest a patch? I believe remount-ro is already
documented ... somewhere :-).

Well, fsync() error reporting does not really work properly, but I
guess it will save you for the remount-ro case. So the data will be in
the journal, but it will be impossible to replay it...

Yes.

I believe journaling operates on assumption that "either whole sector
is written, or nothing at all is written".

I don't think that works. Compactflash (etc) cards basically randomly
remap the data, so you can't really run flash filesystem over
compactflash/usb/SD card -- you don't know the details of remapping.
