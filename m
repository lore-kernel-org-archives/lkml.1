Linus's release announcement for -rc9 suggested 2.6.27 could be released
(and the 2.6.28 merge window opened) any day now.

What I'm currently planning to merge is the contents of

	git://linux-nfs.org/~bfields/linux.git for-2.6.28

summarized below.

Chuck's contributed a ton of small patches preparing for ipv6 support
(which we expect to complete in 2.6.29), Tom Tucker has added support
for fast memory registration to the server rdma code, and Benny's
NFSv4.1 work continues to produce miscellaneous NFSv4.1 bugfixes and
cleanups.

There's also one pure locking patch, which makes vfs support for posix
locking configurable.

And I've got some grace period patches (which I hope will also pave the
way for nfsd lock migration support in 2.6.29), and some minor tweaks to
our rpcsec_gss code which (together with recent nfs-utils patches)
finally makes rpcsec_gss for v2 and v3 work as well as it does for v4.

Thanks to everyone who's contributed!
