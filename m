I was worried about the case when we call try_to_free_buffers() again,
it races with the current transaction commit again. Is it possible? I
guess the question is whether it is possible to have buffers on the same
page attached to different transaction.  If so, I think we need to keep
the journal state lock while retry try_to_free_buffers(), so that the
retry won't race with the commit transaction again...

Thanks for pointing this out.

For try_to_release_page(),we should wait only when (__GFP_WAIT &
__GFP_FS), isn't it?
