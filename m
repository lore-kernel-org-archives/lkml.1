Woops, something to update :-)

This should be all you need, forget the below. The manual unplugging
only really makes sense for very select situations, since it'll be done
when someone waits on the buffer anyway. And the block layer will unplug
implicitly if 3ms has passed or 4 requests are pending, if someone
hasn't done a wait for a page/bh in flight for that device anyway.

So at least with the current setup, it'll only really make a difference
if you end up waiting on the buffer 1-2ms after submission and you
haven't submitted enough IO to kick off the unplugging. If you wait
immediately, the time period between your blk_unplug() call and the one
that wait_on_bit() would do is so short that it will not make a
difference. And if you don't wait on the IO, you just want to let it hit
the disk eventually.

There's really not a lot of point to doing it this way, since
wait_on_buffer() will immediately do an unplug of the device anyway.

So it's quite on purpose that I didn't do a lot of tracking for this and
manual unplugging, we simply don't need it.

Ugh, this one is nasty!

        blk_run_address_space(mapping);

would be a lot cleaner.
