Depends on whether you think LSM hooks are like netfilter hooks (i.e.
fine for each module to just implement a few here and there, then
combine resulting modules), or whether they are about implementing
complete security models (ala SELinux or Smack).  As they currently
exist, they aren't very well suited to the former - they impose a cost
on all hooked operations in order to hook any at all, as has been a
concern for your device controller.

Likely not a popular view, but capabilities don't belong in LSM.  Look
at them:  the capability state is still directly embedded in the
relevant kernel data structures, various bits of capability specific
logic and interfaces remain in the core kernel, they don't present a
complete security model (just an auxiliary to some other model like DAC
or Smack for privilege purposes), they use only a small subset of the
hooks, they force LSM to violate its usual restrictive-only paradigm to
support capable(), CONFIG_SECURITY=n still has to invoke the capability
functions, and all of the other LSMs do need to call it the same way to
keep Linux working as expected for applications and users.

The original promise was that LSM would allow kernels to be built that
shed capabilities altogether, but in practice no one seems to do that as
both users and applications expect them to exist in Linux.  In fact, the
possibility of not having capabilities present has caused problems that
have led to the dummy module being turned more and more into a clone of
the capabilities module (actually managing and testing the capability
bits rather than just uid == 0 as originally).

So I wouldn't point to capabilities as a counter example to James' point
- they are actually a supporting example.
