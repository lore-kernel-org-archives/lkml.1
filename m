Since this patch hit fsdev, there have been an equal number
of supporters and opponents of the timeout.

I'm not opposed to the timeout on the API, but I don't think
it is needed if we have a system configurable timeout (default
is no timeout) that can be changed by an admin.

My experience is that a timeout is not needed protect against
a stupid admin or against software bugs.

The justification for a timeout as far as I am concerned
is so the admin can log in and reset hung hardware.  If we
think there is no chance of forcing the external device that
went to sleep to respond so the system can continue to be used,
then I don't think a timeout has any valid use.

My timeout desire is based on some past SAN behavior and
I'm OK if people argue those devices should just be fixed.
But we argued the same thing and were ignored because bad
device behavior did not stop people from buying them.
