Unfortunately, I did not succeed to get good performance number that
prove this patch had some benefit.

direct-io -EIO problem was already fixed by following patch.

    VFS: fix dio write returning EIO when try_to_release_page fails

Dio falls back to buffered write when dio write gets EIO due to failure of try_to_release_page
by above patch. So I think just reverting the patch 3f31fddf ("jbd: fix race between 
free buffer and commit transaction") is good approach.
