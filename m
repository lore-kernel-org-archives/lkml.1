Me too.  Anecdotally, I haven't noticed this in my lab machines, but
what I have noticed is on someone else's laptop (a hyperthreaded atom)
that I was trying to demo powertop on was that IPI reschedule interrupts
seem to be out of control ... they were ticking over at a really high
rate and preventing the CPU from spending much time in the low C and P
states.  To me this implicates some scheduler problem since that's the
primary producer of IPI reschedules ... I think it wouldn't be a
significant extrapolation to predict that the scheduler might be the
cause of the above problem as well.
