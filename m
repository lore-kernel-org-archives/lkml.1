Hi Jan,
Thank you for your reply.

Yes.

Yes.  The filesystem should be marked with an error, so fsck will check
and recover the filesystem on boot.  But this means the filesystem loses
some latest updates even if it was cleanly unmounted (although some file
data has been lost.)  I'm a bit afraid that some people would think of
this as a regression due to this PATCH 4/5.  At least, to avoid
undesirable replay, we had better keep journaled data only when the
journal has been aborted for checkpointing related reason.

I think it is correct behavior to discard _all_ metadata updates
in the running transaction on abort.  But, we don't hope some of
metadata updates are often discarded, do we?
