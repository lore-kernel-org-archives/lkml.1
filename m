funny ...

I'd laugh about this if the matter wasnt so serious. According 
to two testers so far aic7xxx is essentially useless in 2.6.29. 

James, what is your action plan to deal with it? A bad commit 
was identified and reverting these commits:

c27aed5: Revert "[SCSI] scsi_lib: fix DID_RESET status problems"
3cd94dd: Revert "[SCSI] scsi_lib: don't decrement busy counters when inserting comma
0eb6038: Revert "[SCSI] Fix error handling for DIF/DIX"
84db545: Revert "[SCSI] Fix uninitialized variable error in scsi_io_completion"
813104e: Revert "[SCSI] simplify scsi_io_completion()"

fixed the bug according to my testing. Something needs to happen 
and you are the SCSI maintainer.

	Ingo
