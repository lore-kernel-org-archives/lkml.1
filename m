That assumes an mtime update for every write().  OK, so two writes in a
single nanosecond won't be happening.  But in that case why is this code:

static inline struct timespec ext4_current_time(struct inode *inode)
{
	return (inode->i_sb->s_time_gran < NSEC_PER_SEC) ?
		current_fs_time(inode->i_sb) : CURRENT_TIME_SEC;
}

checking (s_time_gran < NSEC_PER_SEC) ??

Overall it is a bit unpleasing to rely upon mtime updates for a correct NFS
server implementation: if we were to later decrease s_time_gran (as we
might do, for performance reasons), the NFS server implementation starts
reporting incorrect information.

That would work.
