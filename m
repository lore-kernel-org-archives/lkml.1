I am trying to boot a vanilla kernel on this machine for the first
time. Haven't tried any other kernels. Will give it a try.

Some more information if this could be of any help.

So the other thing i noticed was that this machine was running
a kernel with selinux enabled. I turned off selinux and there
were no issues during bootup. It was a clean boot.

Thanks
