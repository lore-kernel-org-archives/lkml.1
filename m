Both ATA and SCSI leave it up to the device to decide
whether reads after a trim on a logical block are
determinate (i.e. zeroes are returned) or indeterminate.

In the case of ATA the IDENTIFY DEVICE data word 69 bit
14 gives the indication. In the case of SCSI the
READ CAPACITY(16) command response TPRZ bit gives the
indication. In both case a value of one indicates
determinate.
