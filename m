It is very much exported with plain EXPORT_SYMBOL(). If not then I would have
trouble in exofs as a module and so will lots of other Kernel modules. It is
used in more then one place.

"contiguous" scatterlist array is only up to 128 max on x86_64. This is
the trivial case that is easy to implement with direct bio_xxx exported
calls. The problem start when we need chained scatterlist, to chained
bios, and do not want to invent the block-layer for that.

If you want to consider long term. Then I think Tejum's suggestion is best.
That is: To separate scatterlist into a virtual-part and physical-dma-part.
The former just being a reincarnation of bvec (Held at bio as you imagined)
and the later filled and returned by IOMMUs.

No, in the OSD case I receive a bio that was either built by the block-layer
itself, in the case of a stacking block device, or one built from a filesystem
with the use of exported bio API, that is bio_alloc+bio_add_pc_page*128.

So if bio will use the new-scatterlist internally, it will not affect any of
OSD code since it tries not to touch any bio internal parts.

Yes, time will tell. One good thing is that things are chainging and
a solution will present itself.
