Some people do ack other people's work. See for example patches #1
and #24 in my recent post. You're welcome.

I've asked before, and I repeat now: can you enumerate these "big"
scary differences that make it such a "big" problem ?

So far, we identified two main "design" issues -

1) Whether or not allow c/r of sub-container (partial hierarchy)

2) Creation of restarting process hierarchy in kernel or in userspace

As for #1, you are the _only_ one who advocates restricting c/r to
a full container only. I guess you have your reasons, but I'm unsure
what they may be.

On the other hand, there has been a handful of use-cases and opinions
in favor of allowing both capabilities to co-exist. Not the mention
that nearly no additional code is necessary, on the contrary.

As for #2, you didn't even bother to reply to the discussion that I
had started about it. This decision is important to allow future
flexibility of the mechanism, and to address the needs of several
potential users, as seen in that discussion and others. Here, too,
you are the _only_ one that advocates that direction.

And the funniest thing -- *both* decisions can be *easily* overturned
in my patchset. In fact, regarding #2 - either way can be easily done
in it.

So I wonder, what are the "big" issues that bother you so much ?
"if there is a will, there is a way".

Eh... and you have it all sorted out ?  (yeah, I do, but not in
this patchset).

Oh well ... "the" code meaning "your" code I suppose.

So you actually took the time to read and review. And then you spent
even more time in .... calculating this number !  Feedback appreciated.

If you looked closely you would have seen that we do address your
concerns over time.

A good reason to break it into small pieces is for ease of maintenance
and debugging, as well as in the future easier transition between
incompatible kernel versions. I think it's better than a few-pages-long
single struct. And it encourages more naming of things.

But ... I'm confused ... is this your "big" concern ?  Oh well, if
that's what stands in your way, we could even rework that (~1.3% of
the code ? I reckon...).

Yes. Let's indeed talk about how to get it "right". Please do
participate in the public discussions and efforts. Working together
would be better for everyone.

It is far from perfect. In fact, it's even clearly commented as such,
and exactly there.  It would have been helpful if you pointed that
out in a review, or even - god forbid - sent a patch to improve it.

But it works, and it lets people play with a more-than-a-toy
implementation and provide us with important feedback. Oh, and by
the way, it doesn't require that people use containers to try it out.
Pretty handy, don't you think ?

Have you not yet read enough opinion of users that would like to see
this capability ?  What would be enough to convince you ?  And really,
why not ?

Cheers,

Oren.
