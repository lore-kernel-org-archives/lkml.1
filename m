Not reordering is not enough to support the barrier primitive, unless
you always go to the same device and pass the barrier flag down with it.

I think having the check in generic_make_request() is perfectly fine,
even if the value doesn't completely apply to stacked devices. Perhaps
we can add such a value, then. My main point is that barrier support
should be opt-in, not a default thing. Over time we should have support
everywhere, but it needs to be checked, audited, and trusted.
