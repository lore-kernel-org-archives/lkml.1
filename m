Thank you for the explanation of scsi's rq->data_len usage.
I see that scsi usually uses rq->data_len for cmd->resid.

I have investigated the possibility of setting data_len before
the call to blk_end_request.
But no matter whether data_len is touched or not, we need a callback
for bidi.  So I would like to go with the current patch.

I explained the reason and some details below.


As far as I can see, rq->data_len is just referenced
by blk_add_trace_rq() in __end_that_request_first(), not modified.
And I don't change any logic around there in the block-layer.
So there shouldn't be any critical problem for scsi residual handing.
(although I'm not sure that scsi expectes cmd->resid to be traced
 by blk_trace.)

Anyway, I see that it is no critical problem for bidi to set cmd->resid
to rq->data_len before blk_end_request() call.
But if I do that, blk_end_request() can't get the next_rq's size
to complete in its code below.

> +			return 1;

So I will have to move next_rq completion to bidi and use _callback()
anyway like the following.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
static int dummy_cb(struct request *rq)
{
	return 1;
}

void scsi_end_bidi_request(struct scsi_cmnd *cmd)
{
 	struct request *req = cmd->request;
	unsigned int dlen = req->data_len;
	unsigned int next_dlen = req->next_rq->data_len;
 
 	req->data_len = scsi_out(cmd)->resid;
 	req->next_rq->data_len = scsi_in(cmd)->resid;
 
	/* Complete only DATA of next_rq using _callback and dummy function */
	if (!blk_end_request_callback(req->next_rq, 1, next_dlen, dummy_cb))
		BUG();
 
	if (blk_end_request(req, 1, dlen))
		BUG();

	scsi_release_buffers(cmd);
	scsi_next_command(cmd);
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I prefer the current patch rather than the code like above,
since the code calls blk_end_request twice and looks trickier.
So I'd like to leave the patch but descriptions and comments in it.
Below is the patch, which updated only descriptions and comments.
If you still have some concerns on this, please let me know.



Subject: [PATCH 27/28] blk_end_request: changing scsi mid-layer for bidi (take 3)

This patch converts bidi of scsi mid-layer to use blk_end_request
interfaces.

rq->next_rq represents a pair of bidi requests.
(There are no other use of 'next_rq' of struct request.)
For both requests in the pair, end_that_request_chunk() should be
called before end_that_request_last() is called for one of them.
Since the calls to end_that_request_first()/chunk() and
end_that_request_last() are packaged into blk_end_request(),
the handling of next_rq completion has to be moved into
blk_end_request(), too.

Since blk_end_request() family don't have any argument for
the completion size of next_rq, they use next_rq->data_len for it.
So bidi has to set the resid after blk_end_request() completes
the data of next_rq.
To satisfy the requirement, bidi uses blk_end_request_callback(),
which is added in PATCH 25 only for the tricky drivers.
