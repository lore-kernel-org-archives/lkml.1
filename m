This will uncover internal details of SG-chaining implementation, which 
you wanted to hide. Or didn't?

blk_queue_bounce() does another and completely independent level of 
bouncing for pages allocated in the not accessible by the device area.

Will be fixed.

(BTW, the SCSI layer assumes large CDBs as single big buffers, but all 
SCSI transports I checked transfer large CDBs in 2 different parts: the 
first 16 bytes and the rest. I.e. they deal with 2 different buffers. 
So, the target side (SCST) deals with 2 buffers for large CDBs as well. 
Having only one req->cmd will force SCST to merge those 2 buffers into a 
single buffer. So, scs[i,t]_execute_async() will have to make an 
allocation for this as well.)

Perhaps, yes.

Perhaps, yes, but only for possible future use. I don't see any use of 
it at the moment.
