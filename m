Sounds a workable solution.

That's surely good.

Well, if you could remove the usage of request structure that are not
came from blk_get_request, it will be super. But it's a different
topic and Tejun can go forward without such change.

I think that Tejun will drop some of the patchset. At least, we don't
need blk_rq_map_kern_prealloc stuff. I think that Tejun doesn't need
to play with the mapping API. Well, we need to play with the mapping
API for OSD but it's not directly related with the block layer
cleanups necessary for the libata SCSI separation.

Tejun?
