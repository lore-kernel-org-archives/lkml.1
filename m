The best solution would be if some storage driver person would
take on the SX4 challenge and work towards integrating the SX4
into Linux' RAID framework.

If no-one steps forward I'll take over Jeff's SX4 card and just
maintain sata_sx4 as a plain non-RAID driver. Unfortunately I
don't have the time needed to turn it into a decent RAID or
RAID-offload driver myself.
