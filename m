I guess writeback code can handle nr_to_write going negative. If we are
not updating wbc->nr_to_write then i guess writeback code will get a 
wrong value for number of pages written and can end up doing wrong things
We had it that way as a part of 22208dedbd7626e5fc4339c417f8d24cc21f79d7
and i guess we didn't had any problems with that

So for the patch
