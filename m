Agreed - it's not as straight forward as a mirror, and it kind of assumes
that you have software RAID.

/me had his head stuck in hw raid land ;)

The drive is not the only source of errors, though.  You could
have a path problem that is corrupting random bits between the drive
and the filesystem. So the data on the disk might be fine, and
reading it via a redundant path might be all that is needed.

Yeah, so I can see how having a different retry semantic would be a
good idea. i.e. if we do a READ_VERIFY I/O, the underlying device
attempts to verify the data is good in as many ways as possible
before returning the verified data or an error.

I guess a filesystem read would become something like this:

	verified = 0
	error = read(block)
	if (error) {
read_verify:
		error = read_verify(block)
		if (error) {
			OMG THE SKY IS FALLING
			return error
		}
		verified = 1
	}
	/* check contents */
	if (contents are bad) {
		if (!verified)
			goto read_verify
		OMG THE SKY HAS FALLEN
		return -EIO
	}

Is this the sort of erro handling and re-issuing of
I/O that you had in mind?

FWIW, I don't think this really removes the need for a filesystem to
be able to keep multiple copies of stuff about. If the copy(s) on a
device are gone, you've still got to have another copy somewhere
else to get it back...

Cheers,

Dave.
