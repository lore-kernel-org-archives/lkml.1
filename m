Ok, so now for the hard questions - what are the semantics of
FA_ALLOCATE and FA_DEALLOCATE?

For FA_ALLOCATE, it's supposed to change the file size if we
allocate past EOF, right? What's the return value supposed to
be? Zero for success, error otherwise? Does this update a/m/ctime
at all? How persistent is this preallocation? Should it be
there "forever" or for the lifetime of the currently open fd
that it was preallocated on?

For FA_DEALLOCATE, does it change the filesize at all? Or does
it just punch a hole in the file? If it does change file size,
what happens when you punch out preallocation beyond EOF?
What's the return value supposed to be?

FWIW, we definitely need a FA_PREALLOCATE mode (FA_ALLOCATE but does
not change file size) so we can preallocate beyond EOF for apps which
use O_APPEND (i.e. changing file size would cause problems for them).

I'll have ia64 soon.

And that's what I'm doing now, hence all the questions ;)

BTW, do you have a test program for this, or will I need to write
one myself?

Cheers,
