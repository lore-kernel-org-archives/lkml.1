umm, OK, but...

There's not really a lot of point in testing
journal->j_checkpoint_transactions inside j_state_lock, is there? 
Hence local variable chkpt isn't really needed.

But log_do_checkpoint() already checks to see if there are any
checkpointing transactions upon which to operate, so rather than doing
log_do_checkpoint()'s work for it, perhaps it would be cleaner to teach
log_do_checkpoint() to tell the caller whether it manage to do any
work?

The nice thing about that is that even if
journal->j_checkpoint_transactions is NULL, log_do_checkpoint() might
still be able to do some useful work in cleanup_journal_tail().

otoh, two existing callers of log_do_checkpoint() already test
journal->j_checkpoint_transactions before calling log_do_checkpoint(),
so maybe that's pretty pointless.

otoh2, those existing callers do the seemingly-unneeded
spin_lock(j_list_lock).  hrm.  So if we're playing match-the-existing
code, we should go with your first patches.

ho hum, I guess I'll do "otoh2".
