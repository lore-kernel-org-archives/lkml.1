We thought about that also, but then the caller needs to do all of the
pointer gymnastics themselves like:

     ext4_inode_get_xtime(&inode->i_ctime, &inode->i_ctime_extra,
                         &raw_inode->i_ctime, &raw_inode->i_ctime_extra)

instead of the current:

     EXT4_INODE_GET_XTIME(ctime, inode, raw_inode);

IMHO it is preferrable to make the multiple callsites more readable than
the macros.

This is actually unrelated to the current patch, just part of the context.
AFAIK, this is historical, so that the kernel and e2fsprogs can use the
same ext2_fs.h header.  I don't think it is really needed, but such cleanup
shouldn't be a part of this patch either.

Yes, this is possible if an ext2/3/4 filesystem is formatted with 128-byte
inodes (which is the default for all but ext4) and this fs is mounted as
ext4dev.  The inodes can never hold the extra time information (FITS_IN_INODE
check above) so the superblock limits the timestamp resolution to 1s in that
case.

It is the inode creation time.  This is useful for debug/forensic purposes,
and at some point there will be an API so that Samba can use it also.

Hmm, I'm sure there were emails on the topic, but they aren't attached to
the patch.  s_want_extra_isize is just an override for sizeof(ext4_inode)
in case the sysadmin wants to reserve more fields in new inodes.  There is
also s_min_extra_isize which is what the kernel and e2fsck guarantee that
will be available in all in-use inodes, if RO_COMPAT_EXTRA_ISIZE is set
(ro-compat so that older kernels can't create inodes with a smaller
extra_isize).  That feature is only enabled if requested by the sysadmin.

Cheers, Andreas
