Just so it doesn't get lost (discussed w/ Ted today) I think this 2nd
hunk flipped the wrong buffer funtion; this makes much more sense to me:

@@ -157,7 +156,7 @@ static int journal_submit_commit_record(journal_t
*journal,

 		/* And try again, without the barrier */
 		lock_buffer(bh);
		set_buffer_uptodate(bh);

+		clear_buffer_dirty(bh);
 		ret = submit_bh(WRITE, bh);
