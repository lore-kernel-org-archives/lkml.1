At least, for SuperWhizBang to comply with NFSv4.1 requirements it
needs to follow the IETF process as an open protocol and address
important semantic details (as listed by nfsv4.1) on-top of the
wire data structures like security considerations and client fencing.

Being open source or not is somewhat orthogonal to that since
from the protocol specification one should be able to implement
a fully comply client and/or server.

What you're basically saying is similar to rejecting the filesystem export
kABI since this will cause a never-ending arms race for the best file
system.  (a.k.a. "640KB of RAM and FAT file system is likely anything
that a sane user will ever need"... ;-)

I believe that competition is good.  Good for customers, for which the pNFS
protocol was designed for, and good for vendors as well.  The extra complexity
is there since one-size does not fit all.  Different storage technologies
fit certain applications better than others and exposing storage for
direct client access can convey these strengths all the way up to the host
running the application.

Besides, the pNFS specification was also driven by customers that use
proprietary clustered filesystems today, that use block or object-based
storage.  These customers want pNFS to be a standard to steam up
competition for several reasons, like:
- encourage open source implementations
- second source availability
- building best-of-breed systems by integrating
  parts from different vendors
- reuse of existing storage and networking infrastructure
