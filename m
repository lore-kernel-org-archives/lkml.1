At which point you run "unfreeze /mnt/fs" and unfreeze it.

If you've got a script that fails in the middle of an operation that
freezes the filesystem, then the error handling of that script
needs to unfreeze the filesystem. The kernel does not need to do
this.

No, it can be handled by userspace perfectly well.

If freeze_bdev() hangs, then you've got a buggy filesystem and far
more problems to worry about than undoing the freeze. It's likely
you're going to need a reboot to unwedge then hung filesystem.....

Can be fixed from userspace.

Application bug. Undeadlock it by running "unfreeze /mnt/fs"....

FWIW, DM is quite capable of freezing the filesystem, snapshotting
it and then unfreezing it without hanging, crashing or having nasty
stuff in general happen. We've used 'xfs_freeze -f /mnt/fs;
do_something; xfs_freeze -u /mnt/fs' for years without having
problems with freeze hanging, application deadlocks, etc.....

... And if something has gone wrong during the freeze, it is far,
far better to leave the filesystem stuck in a frozen state than to
unfreeze it and allow it to be damaged further. If you get stuck or
a script gets killed in the middle of execution, then an admin needs
to look at the problem immediately. Just timing out and unfreezing
is about the worst thing you can do because it allows problems
(corruptions, errors, etc) to be propagated and potentially make
things worse before an admin can intervene and fix things up....

Basically, I don't want to have to deal with the "snapshot
image corrupt" bug reports that will come from user
misuse/misunderstanding of the "freeze timeout". It's hard enough
tracking down these sorts of problems without throwing in the
"freeze timed out before completion" possibility that guarantees
a non-consistent snapshot image.....

/me points to the ASSERT_ALWAYS() in xfs_attr_quiesce() that ensures
we get bug reports when the filesystem is still being actively
modified when the freeze "completes".

And that should already be the case. If write_super_lockfs() hangs,
then you've got a filesystem bug ;)

Cheers,
