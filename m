Subject: [PATCH 1/9]: introduce radix_tree_gang_lookup_range

Introduce radix_tree_gang_lookup_range()

The inode clustering in XFS requires a gang lookup on the radix tree to
find all the inodes in the cluster.  The gang lookup has to set the
maximum items to that of a fully populated cluster so we get all the
inodes in the cluster, but we only populate the radix tree sparsely (on
demand).

As a result, the gang lookup can search way, way past the index of end
of the cluster because it is looking for a fixed number of entries to
return.

We know we want to terminate the search at either a specific index or a
maximum number of items, so we need to add a "last_index" parameter to
the lookup.

Furthermore, the existing radix_tree_gang_lookup() can use this same
function if we define a RADIX_TREE_MAX_INDEX value so the search is not
limited by the last_index.
