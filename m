You can not put kobjects in /sys/devices/ and there will be no
disconnected kobject tree just for scsi, unless the scsi maintainers
really want want that, and then they should create their own
filesystem instead, and not use kobjects at all.

If you want to integrate with the current scsi devices/objects, which
is the only sensible option I think, you have to use struct device
devices, kobjects will not get a classification in sysfs, and will be
invisible for userspace tools unless you do random readdir() in
/sys/devices/ to find them.
