You can choose to have comments included in the kernel-doc's collected
output.  You do this by using this notation:

/** DOC <topic_name>:
 * <these lines are added to kernel-doc output when you use:
!P<filename> <topic_name>
 * a Documentation/DocBook/*.tmpl file.
 */

See Documentation/DocBook/mac80211.tmpl for examples.

Johannes, I thought that you had some usage documentation for DOC:.
Did you not or did it not get merged??
It needs to be added to Documentation/kernel-doc-nano-HOWTO.txt.

Nope.  It can (a) be longer than 80 characters (an exception is made here)
or (b) split up like this:

/**
 * func_name - some short description here
 * @prm1: prm1 description
 * @prmn: prmn description
 *
 * <longer function description here>

I've debugged plenty of code so I'll respectfully disagree with you.
It's confusing and ugly.  But I don't control whether it is merged upstream
or not.
