I'm having some difficulty thinking of a good way to troubleshoot this, list
poisening is on by default, and I don't think any other kind of quick switches
that would help flush this bug out.  One thing I was thinking about, what if
somebody comes right behind us trying to commit a separate transaction?  I think
this could be possible as by the time we get to the
journal_write_revoke_records() we aren't holding any locks on the journal
itself, so we could come behind the transaction thats currently running, and
switch the revoke record tables on it while its doing its thing.  Do you have
any suggestions on a good way to approach this problem?  And as for my newest
theory, what have I not thought of :).  Thank you,

Josef
