Found root cause-- root cause is asterisk PBX software.  I use an SPA3102.
When someone called me, they accidentally dropped the connection, I called
them back in a short period.  It is during this time (and the last time)
this happened that the box froze under multiple(!) kernels, always when
someone was calling.

I have removed asterisk but this is the version I was running:
~$ dpkg -l | grep -i asterisk
rc  asterisk                             1:1.6.2.0~dfsg~rc1-1             Open S

I don't know what asterisk is doing but top did run before the crash
and asterisk was using 100% CPU and as I noted before all other processes
were in D-state.

When this bug occurs, it freezes I/O to all devices and the only way to recover
is to reboot the system.

Just FYI if anyone else out there has their system crash when running asterisk.

Just out of curiosity, has anyone else running asterisk had such an issue? 
I was not running any special VoIP PCI cards/etc.

Justin.
