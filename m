Greg, what's your take on the quality of this new driver? Do you have 
some time to do a review of this with drivers/staging/ versus drivers/ 
glasses on? The Git URI is at:

  master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jejb/scsi-rc-fixes-2.6 master

To me, after a very quick skimming of it it's borderline. The driver 
looks like proper Linux code at first sight in places, but i can see 
_lots_ of (as in thousands of) odd bits - at least odd for a newly 
submitted driver:

 - 200+ instances of bfa_boolean_t, which is defined via:

  enum bfa_boolean {
          BFA_FALSE = 0,
          BFA_TRUE  = 1
  };
  #define bfa_boolean_t enum bfa_boolean

  that should be bool simply.

 - the driver is full with misaligned vertical spacing like:

struct bfa_pcidev_s {
	int             pci_slot;
	u8         pci_func;
	u16	device_id;
	bfa_os_addr_t   pci_bar_kva;
};

void
bfa_timer_beat(struct bfa_timer_mod_s *mod)
{
	struct list_head        *qh = &mod->timer_q;
	struct list_head        *qe, *qe_next;
	struct bfa_timer_s *elem;
	struct list_head         timedout_q;

   which suggests that this driver was treated with a
   de-ugly-ifying sed job without a human looking at the result. There's
   over a thousand (!) of such instances in the driver.

 - various forms of avoidable whitespace damage: for example 873 
   instances of 'space' character followed by 'tab'.

 - bfa_timer.c looks weird - implements a naive timeout mechanism on top
   of real timers? Why not use real timers in to begin with?

 - Also, the .h files are layed out oddly. Bits of them are in 
   include/*, bits of them in *.h.

 - the 90+ easily avoidable stylistic details attached below in
   drivers/scsi/bfa/fcbuild.c.

 - accesses to cmnd->host_scribble both seem an ancient method, and 
   are also somewhat SMP-barrier-unclean. (i'm sure it works and is 
   correct in practice as there are heavy, serializing functions around 
   those places, but the casts still look ugly and there are no 
   barriers.)

 - The 290+ instances of bfa_assert() uses should probably be BUG_ON()s 
   or WARN_ON()s instead of a wrapped panic. Nothing ever defines 
   BFA_PERF_BUILD so the wrapping seems removable.

havent looked further and these are all easily addressed by just looking 
at the code and doing fixes that dont impact the resulting .o - so very 
easy to do en masse.

I dont know what's the current mainline inclusion quality threshold for 
non-staging Linux drivers - it might be ok. Also, the driver commit has 
been rebased a few days ago which makes it hard to see its stability 
track record.

	Ingo
