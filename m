Not by me, though I don't think this patch will make that any better or
worse. It should just change how the thread is spawned. My testing
mostly consisted of making sure that we could reclaim locks after this
was applied.

Well, just before that we do this:

    list_del_init(&fl->fl_u.nfs_fl.list);

...and a little while after, we do this:

    list_add_tail(&fl->fl_u.nfs_fl.list, &host->h_granted);

...so I assume the fact that the fl doesn't end up back on a list if
we're signalled is the problem. If so, then yes, it does look like we're
still leaking memory there.

I've never heard of anyone needing to signal the reclaimer thread, so
maybe we should just make it ignore all signals?

Yep. All of lockd does, though IIRC that's held up by dependencies on
the BKL in generic VFS locking code. Pulling the BKL out of lockd is
probably going to be painful since it's almost surely hiding some
races.
