Perhaps I'm missing something, but why do you think sysfs hierarchy for 
a SCSI target subsystem can't be put anywhere, but only in /sys/devices?

Consider /sys/class/scsi_host/ as an example. It is very close to what 
SCST needs.

And don't forget a SCSI target subsystem, basically, has from 
implementation POV in common with the regular SCSI (initiator) subsystem 
only some constants for commands and errors and "SCSI" word in the name. 
All the internal processing is completely different, similarly to 
difference between Firefox and Apache, mutt and sendmail, NFS client and 
server.
