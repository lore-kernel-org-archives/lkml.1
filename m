Also, I would like to raise a couple of other points too here.
The number of targets that will be generated will be completely
transparent to the user and there is no way to figure that out from
the userland.
All that the user know is the LV thats created, and it will try to
issue ioctl's on that. Also, the error that is returned is not that
friendly, i mean it just return with an error value of -1, without
even providing any error messages.
I wish to add atleast a proper error message to the same, if we are
not providing ioctl's at the mapped_device level.
