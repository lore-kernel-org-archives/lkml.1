Hi Neil,

Thanks for the suggestion, it has been used here:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/2/27/66

Looks like an EXT4 issue as XFS does ~600MiB/s..?

Its strange though, on a single hard disk, I get approximately the same 
speed for XFS and EXT4, but when it comes to scaling across multiple disks,
in RAID-0 or RAID-5 (tested), there is a performance problem as it hits a
performance problem at ~350MiB/s.  I tried multiple chunk sizes but nothing
seemed to made a difference (whether 64KiB or 1024KiB), XFS performs at
500-600MiB/s no matter what and EXT4 does not exceed ~350MiB/s.

Is there anyone on any of the lists that gets > 350MiB/s on a mdadm/sw raid
with EXT4?

A single raw disk, no partitions:

A single raw disk formatted with XFS, no partitions:

XFS tests: (550-600MiB/s)
