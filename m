Yes, I've been trying to pay attention....

The evidence does seem to point to raid5 and degraded arrays being
implicated.  However I'm having trouble finding how the fact that an array
is degraded would be visible down in the elevator except for having a
slightly different distribution of reads and writes.

One possible way is that if an array is degraded, then some read
requests will go through the stripe cache rather than direct to the
device.  However I would more expect the direct-to-device path to have
problems as it is much newer code.  Going through the cache for reads
is very well tested code - and reads come from the cache for most
writes anyway, so the elevator will still see lots of single-page.
reads.  It only ever sees single-page write.

There might be more pressure on the stripe cache when running
degraded, so we might call the ->unplug_fn a little more often, but I
doubt that would be noticeable.

As you seem to suggest by the patch, it does look like some sort of
unlocked access to the cfq_queue structure.  However apart from the
comment before cfq_exit_single_io_context being in the wrong place
(should be before __cfq_exit_single_io_context) I cannot see anything
obviously wrong with the locking around that structure.

So I'm afraid I'm stumped too.
