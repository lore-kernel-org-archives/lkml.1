I am not sure what's the rationale behind that. Why to do it at higher
layer? Doing it at IO scheduler layer will make sure that one does not
breaks the IO scheduler's properties with-in cgroup. (See my other mail
with some io-throttling test results).

The advantage of higher layer mechanism is that it can also cover software
RAID devices well.

Yes, from technical point of view, one can implement a proportional BW
controller at higher layer also. But that would practically mean almost
re-implementing the CFQ logic at higher layer. Now why to get into all
that complexity. Why not simply make CFQ hiearchical to also handle the
groups?

Secondly, think of following odd scenarios if we implement a higher level
proportional BW controller which can offer the same feature as CFQ and
also can handle group scheduling.

Case1:
======	 
           (Higher level proportional BW controller)
			/dev/sda (CFQ)

So if somebody wants a group scheduling, we will be doing same IO control
at two places (with-in group). Once at higher level and second time at CFQ
level. Does not sound too logical to me.

Case2:
======

           (Higher level proportional BW controller)
			/dev/sda (NOOP)
	
This is other extrememt. Lower level IO scheduler does not offer any kind
of notion of class or prio with-in class and higher level scheduler will
still be maintaining all the infrastructure unnecessarily.

That's why I get back to this simple question again, why not extend the
IO schedulers to handle group scheduling and do both proportional BW and
max bw control there.

Sure. My patchset is still in the infancy stage. So don't expect great
results. But it does highlight the idea and design very well.

Well I meant reduced code in the sense if we implement both max bw and
proportional bw at IO scheduler level instead of proportional BW at
IO scheduler and max bw at higher level.

I agree that doing max bw control at higher level has this advantage that
it covers all the kind of deivces (higher level logical devices) and IO
scheduler level solution does not do that. But this comes at the price
of broken IO scheduler properties with-in cgroup.

Maybe we can then implement both. A higher level max bw controller and a
max bw feature implemented along side proportional BW controller at IO
scheduler level. Folks who use hardware RAID, or single disk devices can
use max bw control of IO scheduler and those using software RAID devices
can use higher level max bw controller.

Sure. My patches have started giving some basic results but because there
is lot of work remaining before a fair comparison can be done on the
basis of performance under various work loads. So some more time to
go before we can do a fair comparison based on numbers.

Sorry, I did not get it clearly. I guess I did not ask the question right.
So lets say I got a setup where there are two phyical devices /dev/sda and
/dev/sdb and I create a logical device (say using device mapper facilities)
on top of these two physical disks. And some application is generating
the IO for logical device lv0.

				Appl
				 |
				lv0
			       /  \
			    sda	   sdb


Where should I put the bandwidth limiting rules now for io-throtle. I 
specify these for lv0 device or for sda and sdb devices?

Thanks
