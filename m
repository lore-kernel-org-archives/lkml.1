Probably the device you're testing against doesn't support RC16, which
is fine.  But for some reason, we're not getting valid sense data back
from the device.  Now, there's two responses to this that seem rational
to me:

 - In sd.c, if the drive has returned no/invalid sense data, try RC10
   silently, just like the 0x20 / 0x24 ASC case.
 - Find out why this drive doesn't report valid sense data when attached
   to hpsa.  I assume it does report valid sense data when attached to
   some other scsi card?
