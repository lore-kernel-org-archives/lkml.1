I'll plead total ignorance about TSO, and it sounds like a long
shot--but sure, it'd be worth trying, thanks.

That's interesting!  So we should probably look more closely at the
svc_check_conn_limits() behavior.  I wonder whether some pathological
behavior is triggered in the case where you're constantly over the limit
it's trying to enforce.

(Remind me how many active clients you have?)
