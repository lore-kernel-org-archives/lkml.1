You do realize that, that was pure lock to have a zero'ed buffer.

Yes it is so. In read_x command a short read is an error status (or short
writes for write_x). The only commands that are allowed short reads 
(with no error) are those commands that have optional sizes like inquiry
and stuff, so if the device does not have the extra info it will return
a short read, of exact number of bytes as permitted by the shorter version
of the command. The initiator will understand that the command return is of
the shorter version. And also REQUEST_SENSE can be short. But all other 
commands must return the number of bytes requested or set a status. Here
the device does not return a shorter MODE_SENSE, it does not return it
at all. A status must be set/emulated.

I would not do that, because:
- This is a per command filter and will not be easy to do right.
- All other drivers will need to be inspected, because mid-layer
  behavior change. Where before the gate was status, then if set
  look at resid. What you propose enables another gate for errors.
  I'm much more lazy then you, and for my peace of mine will not do
  such a subtle change, that I can never fully test for.

If I where you I would fix it at the usb level, where if *no* data
was read/written I would atleast set the DID_NOT_CONNECT status.
(OK I'm not sure what to do here it should be carefully considered)

Also be ware that I think the MODE_SENSE command is mandatory and
you must emulate it if the device does not supports it. (That is
filter for MODE_SENSE command and if returns error, set a sensible
returned buffer with info gathered by other means. Like good'ol 
isd200 does it)
