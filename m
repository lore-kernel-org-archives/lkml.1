I would be very interested in gathering some data in this area.  One
thing that pops to mind is to instrument the resched-ipi with
ftrace_printk() and gather a trace of this system in action.  I assume
that I wouldn't have access to this OLTP suite, so I may need a
volunteer to try this for me.  I could put together an instrumentation
patch for the testers convenience if they prefer.

Another data-point I wouldn't mind seeing is  looking at the scheduler
statistics, particularly with my sched-top utility, which you can find he=
re:

http://rt.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Schedtop_utility

(Note you may want to exclude the sched_info stats, as they are
inherently noisy and make it hard to see the real trends.  To do this
run it with: 'schedtop -x "sched_info"'

In the meantime, I will try similar approaches here on other non-OLTP
based workloads to see if I spy anything that looks amiss.
