Because those are the only two commands for which I'm reasonably
certain the device should never return a nonzero residue with Okay
status.  For other commands there might be a valid positive residue --
although if there is then the device should also return Check Condition
status (the spec is unclear on this point).

Actually I'm a little concerned about the READ CAPACITY command; it's
conceivable that a removable-media device with no media present might
return a valid positive residue.  However the chance of something like
that happening and causing a problem is probably sufficiently small
that we can ignore it.
