I'll add some proper documentation to the list of WRITE* definitions.

I think Ted knew, we did talk about the fact that it would unplug. But
note that it only really changes the number of unplugs for the cases
where you do multiple bh submissions before doing a
wait_on/lock_buffer() since that'll do the unplug anyway. For those
cases we do want to use WRITE_SYNC_PLUG to defer unplugging to the first
wait/lock of the bh.

If you are just doing a single IO submission, whether you do that unplug
in sync_buffer() or explicitly at the IO submission call doesn't make
any difference. In fact, the stack will be shorter from the submission
path by a function call or two.

Certainly, I'll improve it a bit and add it as well.

Well, the caller doesn't really need to know. Basically it boils down to
whether you are going to be waiting on this IO or not. If you are, it's
a sync write. I don't want to add a lot of IO scheduler specifics about
how we treat a sync write differently from an async one.

I'll rewrite the text.
