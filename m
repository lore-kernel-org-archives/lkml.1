  I sent you yesterday the version of the cleanup which should apply to the
latest patch queue. I think you can merge it right away.
 In fact, this series should not depend on the cleanup in ext4 at all, I've
just included it for completeness along with ext3 cleanup of the same
problem (and the patch series depends on ext3 cleanup).

  Yes, we have to agree on VFS changes before ext4 changes make sense.

  Yes, that would be fine. Thanks. Luckily, the dependence is just one way
(ext4 change has to go after the VFS patch) so it's just enough to merge
that ext4 change some time after VFS changes go in.
