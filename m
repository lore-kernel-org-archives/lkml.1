There is one lockd, one statd, and one rpcbind per client.  These are  
shared between all the NFS mounts on the client.  Likewise, there is  
one of each of these per server, and they are shared among all exports.

lockd_up() and lockd_down() maintain a count of mounts and exports,  
and lockd_down() shuts down lockd when the count goes to zero.

statd provides the ability to signal a server when a client reboots  
(and vice versa). This gives the server an indication of when to free  
locks for any applications on a rebooting client, and gives the client  
an indication of when it needs to reclaim locks on a rebooting server.

statd (user space) and lockd (kernel) have to share a cookie  
(mon_name) which is used to identify the client to servers, and the  
server to clients, so reboots can be detected.  That cookie would  
probably need to be the initial utsname.

That works for the main NFS protocol, perhaps, but the auxiliary  
protocols are another matter.  They operate on behalf of a whole  
client or server, not on behalf of an individual mount or export.

Possible, but I would expect this to be a lot of work for not much  
gain.  The right answer is likely that you need a lockd and statd  
instance (virtual or real) for each namespace.  The mounts and exports  
in each namespace would have their own lockd and statd.

Users are assigned credentials.  The credentials are passed from  
client to server, and the server does work on behalf of that  
credential (user).  lockd uses a credential and a process identifier  
to find locks on files.

AUTH_SYS credentials (the lowest common denominator) are constructed  
from the user's UID and GID and the client's utsname.

The kernel, then, will have to construct unique credentials for users  
in each uts namespace.  This is likely not an NFS mount-time issue,  
but is instead part of the mechanism of mapping requests from  
processes to RPC credentials.

OK.  I think what you are saying is that NFS won't work outside of the  
initial uts namespace, for now?

Also, how would an automounter fit into this uts namespace scheme?
