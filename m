It is completely true, you will very rarely see merges between
processes. The plug may be across the entire device and it'll get you
some inter-process sorting as well if you have more than one app busy,
but for merging it's usually effectively per-process.

Linus, the implementation is still basically the same. Yes it's true
that you used to do

        submit();
        unplug(;)
        wait();

and you better still be doing that or things will run at the timer
unplug speed - not very fast. The only difference is that we hide the
unplug in the wait_on_bit() callback, but it's definitely still very
much the same thing.

sync_dirty_buffer() should use it, I agree, I even did the original
patch for it. And in the series posted today, it's also there and it
performs as expected now. For this particular case, it's not about
plugging. The performance penalty came from the 'sync' modifier, it'll
change how the IO schedulers look at the IO. Both AS and CFQ would have
considerably worse performance with this, as you would be mixing related
IO into both sync and async buckets. So it wasn't merging (as suspected)
or plugging.
