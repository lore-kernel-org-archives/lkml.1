Hi,
I apologize for taking so long to review this patch.  I obviously agree
wholeheartedly with Luben.  The problem I ran into while trying to
design an enclosure management interface for the SATA devices is that
there is all this vendor defined stuff.  For example, for the AHCI LED
protocol, the only "defined" LED is 'activity'.  For LED2 and LED3 it
is up to hardware vendors to define these.  For SGPIO there's all kinds
of ways for hw vendors to customize.  I felt that it was going to be a
maintainance nightmare to have to keep track of various vendors
enclosure implementations in the ahci driver, and that it'd be better
to just have user space libraries take care of that.  Plus, that way a
vendor doesn't have to get a patch into the kernel to get their new
spiffy wizzy bang blinky lights working (think of how long it takes
something to even get into a vendor kernel, which is what these guys
care about...).  So I'm still not sold on having an enclosure
abstraction in the kernel - at least for the SATA controllers.
