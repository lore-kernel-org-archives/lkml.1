That is up to the filesystem to determine then.  I just thought it should
be clear to return an error for flags (or as you say combinations thereof)
that the filesystem doesn't understand.

That said, I'd think in most cases the flags are orthogonal, so if you
support some combination of the flags (e.g. FA_FL_DEL_DATA, FA_FL_DEALLOC)
then you will also support other combinations of those flags just from
the way it is coded.

One reason is that XFS does NOT update the mtime/ctime when doing the
XFS_IOC_* allocation ioctls.

I'm only being the advocate for requirements David Chinner has put
forward due to existing behaviour in XFS.  This is one of the reasons
why I think the "flags" mechanism we now have - we can encode the
various different behaviours in any way we want and leave it to the
caller.
