Not quite. Let me rephrase the motivation first:

There are occasions when we would like to keep the checkpoint data in the
kernel for some (relatively long) time, between syscalls. By "checkpoint
data" I mean references to memory contents (pages) and all the other data.

The two scenarios above are two examples: between the syscall to checkpoint
and the syscall to unfreeze and then write-back the data to a file (first
example), and for some time until a task may want to "go back in time"
(second example, useful for ultra fast "undo" for a task).

Note that in both cases when I say "keep in kernel" I mean before it is
written to a file, or to the network. Simply in memory, in some efficient
manner.

Subsequent syscalls will need to refer to a specific checkpoint data that
is kept in memory - e.g. to write-back to a file-descriptor, or to clean
up, or to restart from it. (At any single time a specific container may
have multiple checkpoints associated with it - eg. because they have not
yet been written back to storage but already taken).

Once the data is written back to a file descriptor, the in-kernel data can
be discarded and cleaned-up.

The main reason why I want to keep the data in the kernel and not instead
copy to user space, is efficiency: most of the checkpoint data is the memory
footprint; by keeping the data in the kernel, one can merely keep a COW
reference instead of a whole copy of everything (save space and copy time).

So, if we have keep data in kernel between syscalls, then we must have a
way to refer to it. The current implementation uses a very simple 'crid'
value to do that - although, clearly, at the moment it isn't used.

I hope this explains better.
