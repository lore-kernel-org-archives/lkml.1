When the benchmark runs it writes to stdout and with tee to the result
file. It first writes some information about the system, prepares the
test files (creates lots of small files), calls sync and then starts
the test. Then every minute one line gets written to the result file.
Often I have seen that everything after the sync was missing. But
sometimes it happened that some parts at the end are missing. But it
was always a clean cut, that is there where no lines that where cut
partially. The lines where always complete.
