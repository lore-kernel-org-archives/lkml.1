I forgot to mention ... I didn't add support for 520-byte (or 4104-byte
or 4160-byte) sectors.  Martin helpfully pointed me to
http://www.t13.org/Documents/UploadedDocuments/docs2008/e07162r2-External_Path_Protection.pdf
but it seems like T13 haven't allocated some words for this yet.  If
anyone wants to work on this, please contact me; I have some thoughts.
