Personally, I don't like to see 2.4 and 2.6 in a new driver, and will
tend to try to force it to be 2.6  only.  For an existing driver, I tend
to be much more tolerant: removing the huge gobs of code to achieve 2.6
only is usually a bit disruptive on both the driver and the maintainer

This driver is maintained by 

Yokota Hiroshi <yokota@netlab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp>
GOTO Masanori <gotom@sanori.org>

As it says in the header.  It was last modified in May 2006, so it is
maintained under the somewhat elastic standards of SCSI.  I've cc'd them
to see what they think.
