What USB storage?  And more.

Is it remotely possible that SCSI_WAIT_SCAN could depend on or be 
selected by transports which actually cooperate with scsi_wait_scan?

Also remember:
   - Writing "Depending your initrd, this module may be necessary for
     the system to boot up." and "If unsure, say M." in the Kconfig help
     text is always an option.
   - I haven't built an initrd since ages, but I presume that initrd
     build scripts will complain if an expected module is missing.
   - scsi_wait_scan is a special method to wait for devices during boot
     which only works with some hardware types.  More general methods are
     available and have been in use far longer than scsi_wait_scan
     exists.  Nobody fundamentally needs scsi_wait_scan, it is only a
     convenient tool for some users who choose to use it.
     Special features are traditionally per default off in Kconfig and
     are supposed to be actively enabled.

The sentence "this module may be necessary for the system to boot up" is 
actually applicable to a myriad of options which have a prompt and 
default to off.  The only difference is that most of these options are 
easier to explain.  And that's what it boils down to:  You omitted the 
prompt because you felt it was too hard to explain.

Yeah, or remove the line from .config, or... change scsi/Kconfig to get 
a prompt.
