Okay. Okay. Back up a moment here - Clarify a little. I have the filesystem
set to remount readonly on errors. I have not seen any filesystem
corruption or file corruption I could find. The filesystem *was* remounting
readonly under 2.6.31.5, but has not since .6 came out. (and I reformatted
and redid the entire backup under 2.6.31.6 without errors)

How do I know when it has generated an actual failure that was not
corrected?

How do I know when errors have been detected but they were corrected?

I'm guessing in the former, it'll remount ro, and in the latter it won't. Am
I correct?

I would like to save some money and not trash the usb enclosure... At the
same time, I don't want to use an enclosure that's trashing my data.

It is important to me to know exactly how the failure path operates. Please
explain to me what I will see happen. - Not knowing is driving me nuts.

Thank you,
Tim McGrath
