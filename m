It looks ok, but has some flaws. Try to disable cciss scsi and tape
support:

In file included from drivers/block/cciss.c:231:
drivers/block/cciss_scsi.c:1498:38: error: macro parameters must be
comma-separated
drivers/block/cciss.c: In function 'cciss_seq_show_header':
drivers/block/cciss.c:272: error: implicit declaration of function
'cciss_seq_tape_report'
drivers/block/cciss.c: In function 'cciss_proc_write':
drivers/block/cciss.c:393: error: implicit declaration of function
'cciss_engage_scsi'

You macro definition of cciss_seq_tape_report() is totally busted.
Either write is as a macro OR as a function.

Fix these up and resubmit, then I'll take it.
