No. The only thing that will happen here is that the direct read
will see _none_ of the write because the mmap write occurred during
the DIO read to a different set of pages in memory. There is no
"some" or "all" case here.

IOWs, at a single point in time we have 2 different views
of the one file which are both apparently valid and that is what
we are trying to avoid. We have a coherency problem here which is
solved by forcing the mmap write to reread the data off disk....

Look at it this way - direct I/O in XFS implies an I/O barrier
(similar to a memory barrier). Writing back and tossing out of the
page cache at the start of the direct IO gives us an I/O coherency
barrier - everything before the direct IO is sync'd to disk before
the direct IO can proceed, and everything after the direct IO has
started must be fetched from disk again.

Because mmap I/O doesn't necessarily need I/O to change the state
of a page (think of a read fault then a later write fault), to make
the I/O barrier work correctly with mmap() we need to ensure that
it will fault the page from disk again. We can only do that by
unmapping the pages before tossing them from the page cache.....

Cheers,

Dave.
