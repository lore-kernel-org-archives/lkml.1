OK, NP. But in this case please note on the side all the places you think
might be suspect for blk_rq_bytes()/blk_rq_sectors() cosolidation and post the
list. Because it is now that you are going over the code and it is now that you
touch exactly all these places. 

You could even put a "TODO:" comments on all these places in this patch. So to draw
later patches that audit and remove the TODO:.

(Or in trivial places like above that are safe even before these patches, just
 convert them silently, in the sense of least traffic)

But sure I will see what I can help and send patches for. Tell me when you
think this is stable enough for me to add patches on top of.

Thanks
Boaz
