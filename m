Right now, ext3_show_options has the scheme:

/*
 * Show an option if
 *  - it's set to a non-default value OR
 *  - if the per-sb default is different from the global default
 */

so only non-default is shown, so today barrier=0 is not shown.  I
suppose that could be changed...

FWIW, my patch would show barrier=0 if it's manually mounted that way
(against new proposed defaults), or if we are running w/o barriers due
to a failed barrier IO even though barriers were requested.

... and I've seen hand-waving about shortened drive life running this
way?  but who really knows....
