Without having dived into the patch in detail, one worry I would have is 
that we still might care to spin up a drive for empty transactions in 
order to invalidate the drive's write cache.

For example, if we have the following sequence:

    (1) user app performs series of writes to file A
    (2) pages dirtied from writes to A are destaged to the disk over time
    (3) user app issues fsync(file A) to make sure that the data will 
survive a power outage

At this point in time, would this change prevent us from spinning up the 
drive and invalidating the disk write cache for that fsync() ?

Regards,

Ric
