With the current path, my guess is that we will end up looking
*something* like OpenVZ.  But, with all the input from the OpenVZ folks
and at least three other projects, I bet we can come up with something
better.  I do wish the OpenVZ folks were being more vocal and
constructive about Oren's current code but I guess silence is the
greatest complement...

Basically, yes.  But, practically, we haven't been thinking about
serializing stuff in the kernel, ever.  That's produced a few
difficult-to-serialize things like AF_UNIX sockets but absolutely
nothing that simply can't be done.  

Having this code in mainline and getting some of people's mindshare
should at least enable us to speak up if we see another thing like
AF_UNIX coming down the pipe.  We could hopefully catch it and at least
tweak it a bit to enhance how easily we can serialize it. 

Again, it isn't likely to be an all-or-nothing situation.  It is a
matter of how many hoops the checkpoint code itself has to jump
through.
