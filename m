What we are implementing is not, a sb with a set of tags that are displayed,
but directories with a single tag that is displayed.  The sb just happens
to hold the state for the directories.

A directory displaying only a single tag is an necessary constraint for
a large number of reasons.

Yes. The compare happens to be test_bit. 

With a bitmap you must visit each dirent with a given name and see if
it has a tag that is displayed.

With an array you can lookup the tag aprori and can potentially do a
hash table lookup or a tree lookup and are not required to visit each
entry.

That is just one important aspect of it.   We need a way to describe
which tag a sb,directory pair displays.  It is a fundamental concept.

We need callbacks for interfacing with the kobject layer, and for
selecting our set of tags at mount time.  Not tagged_dir_ops so much
as tagged_type_ops.

     Agreed.

     Essentially agreed.

     Create an sd with a tag, change the tag on a sd.
     Having an untagged sd in a directory that requires tags should
     not be allowed.

> 3. enable / disable tag on a sb
     Disagree that is too flexible.  Tags on a sb need to be
     unchanging or else we get vfs layer issues.

    Further the abstraction is logically exactly one tag on a
    (sb,directory) pair.

    The operations needed are.
    - Select the set of tags on a sb (at mount time)
      This requires we call a set of callbacks.  [ My mount_sb callback ]

    - release a tag (which implies removing all tagged entries and
      removing the sb reference)

4. Interface with the kobject layer.
   kobject_add calls sysfs_create_dir
   kboject_rename calls sysfs_rename_dir 
   kobject_del calls sysfs_remove_dir

   For the first two operations we need a helper function to go from a
   kobject to a tag.

   For the second two operations we need to go from a kobject to a sd.

We don't need callbacks to poll to see if the tags on a sd have
changed.

We need helper functions for interfacing with the rest of the kernel.
