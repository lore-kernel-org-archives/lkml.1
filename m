The sync and other related hangs should be fix with the latest patches
vailable at http://repo.or.cz/w/ext4-patch-queue.git. Using mballoc have
an impact on CPU utilization because we try to build an in-memory extent
map of free blocks available in the group. The cold cache run (the first
run) would take more time because of the time needed to build the extent
map. So repeating the same test and looking at the numbers would help us
understand the impact of in-memory extent building code.

You should be able to apply the patches in the patchqueue mentioned above  to 2.6.26-rc5
Can you test with the same and get the numbers. ? Also delalloc enabled
by default with changes from patchqueue force writeback mode for
journal. So you may want to enable writeback for ext3.
