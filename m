  Are you sure? Because if bufferes are released in ext3_launder_page(),
PagePrivate() has been set to 0 and we should directly fall through to
releasing the page without ever calling try_to_release_page()... So I'd
want to find out why PagePrivate is still set in
invalidate_complete_page2().

  Yes, this would not be enough.
