  Are you seeing this in data=ordered mode? As Andrew pointed out we do
filemap_write_and_wait() so all the relevant data buffers of the inode
should be already on disk. In __journal_try_to_free_buffer() we check
whether the buffer is already-written-out data buffer and unfile and free
it in that case. It shouldn't happen that a data buffer has
b_next_transaction set so really the only idea why try_to_free_buffers()
could fail is that somebody manages to write to a page via mmap before
invalidate_inode_pages2_range() gets to it. Under which kind of load do you
observe the problem? Do you know exactly because of which condition does
journal_try_to_free_buffers() fail?
