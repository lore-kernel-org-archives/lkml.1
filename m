It will always be 64 and won't be increased. For more than 64 cpus "origin"
in the hardware structure above will be > 0 and each bit in the mask
would represent cpu "origin + bit number".

Please leave as is. I did have a few different implementations but they
all looked even worse than this one. If you read the hardware specs then
the current code should be rather easily understandable.
And since the whole documentation is publically availabe in the meantime
I could even add some comments ;)
