This may sound like I'm blaming Andrew, but that is not my intention. He
does a lot of work and he can't (and should not) attempt to fix every
integration and merge issue. Perhaps if I/we were more strict in pushing
every block bit through the block git tree, it wouldn't be so much of an
integration pain. Then the work would be in me to sort out, which I'm
happy to do.

Then there are things like the sg chaining bits, which touch a lot of
arch code. Those are just painful to deal with, for obvious reasons.
Right now there are not in -mm, but that's because of a bug that
prevents Andrews laptop from booting properly.
