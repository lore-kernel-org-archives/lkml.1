Ryo,

Can you also send bio-cgroup patches which apply to 2.6.30-rc1 so that
I can do testing for async writes.

Why have you split the regular patch and bio-cgroup patch? Do you want
to address only reads and sync writes?

In the above test case, do these "fio" jobs finish at different times?
In my testing I see that two dd generate a lot of traffic at IO scheudler
level but traffic seems to be bursty. So when higher weight process has
done some IO, it seems to disappear for .2 to 1 seconds and in that
time other writer gets to do lot of IO and eradicates any service
difference provided so far. 

I am not sure where this high priority writer is blocked and that needs
to be looked into. But I am sure that you will also face the same issue.

Thanks
Vivek
