The best one is simply "fdisk", because you can manually enter your
cylinders numbers. You have to find by hand the beginning of each partition,
and for this, you have to remember what filesystems you used and see how to
identify them (using a magic). Then with an hex editor, you scan the disk to
find such entries and note the possible sectors on a paper. Then comes fdisk.
You create the part, exit and try to mount it. If it fails, fdisk again and
try other values.

I've saved many disks that way, it may sound harder than it really is. It
should not take you more than half an hour to get the first part. Knowing
your approximate partitions size will help too.

Good luck!
