I'm not sure. I know that 2.6.24 Debian EThch-and-a-half worked, 2.6.27+ 
failed. how critical is it to narrow down exactly where the problem crept 
in?

Yinghai Lu, Matthew Wilcox,
   can either of you identify where the problem would have appeared?

I don't know. the current -git kernel fails, but with these two patches 
works. I haven't tried backporting these patches (if there are any changes 
at all needed I probably won't be able to do it)
