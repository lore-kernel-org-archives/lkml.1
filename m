Sorry Balbir, I probably missed your question. Or replied in a different
thread maybe...

Actually we could allow an offending cgroup to continue to submit IO
requests without throttling it directly. But if we don't want to waste
the memory with pending IO requests or pending writeback pages, we need
to block it sooner or later.

Instead of directly throttle the offending applications, we could block
them when we hit a max limit of requests or dirty pages, i.e. something
like congestion_wait(), but that's the same, no? the difference is that
in this case throttling is asynchronous. Or am I oversimplifying it?

As an example, with writeback IO io-throttle doesn't throttle the IO
requests directly, each request instead receives a deadline (depending
on the BW limit) and it's added into a rbtree. Then all the requests are
dispatched asynchronously using a kernel thread (kiothrottled) only when
the deadline is expired.

OK, there's a lot of space for improvements: provide many kernel threads
per block device, multiple queues/rbtrees, etc., but this is actually a
way to apply throttling asynchronously. The fact is that if I don't
apply the throttling also in balance_dirty_pages() (and I did so in the
last io-throttle version) or add a max limit of requests the rbtree
increases indefinitely...

That should be very similar to the proportional BW solution allocating a
quota of nr_requests per block device and per cgroup.
