The initial bsg submit went via the block git tree ... which I believe
you have in -mm.  We only started taking the updates via the scsi tree
when it became evident that they were entangling both scsi and bsg too
deeply to be split between trees.

Actually, it was fixed ... just in a fashion I found to be unacceptable:
making SCSI built in if bsg was selected.

The problem is that there's too much other stuff in -mm.  Whenever
anyone asks where they can get scsi-misc (which is my tree for the next
merge window) from without constructing it themselves in git, I always
say use -mm.  Unfortunately, the attrition rate after telling them this
seems to be really high.

A sort of pre merge window freeze point?

Yes ... particularly in large trees like SCSI, there's the maintainer
"bugger if I don't mail it out now I don't get it in for another three
months" factor.

bsg had actually been sitting in the block tree since 2.6.21, so it had
followed the delayed merge rule ... it just seems that it didn't get
enough integration testing in that six months.  This is what I consider
the real problem to be.

I don't disagree; my point is that bsg did follow this rule (in fact it
tried to stabilise itself outside of mainline for far longer than this
rule implies)  the problem is that it didn't get sufficient integration
testing.

> I don't think it's terribly bad to whack half-baked things (bsg ;)) into

I wouldn't call bsg half baked ... it was very carefully matured.  There
were just a few integration issues.

I agree with this approach too ... that's what I've been doing.  It
means that feature stabilisation must finish at around -rc3.  The
relative quiet from SCSI over the last two releases was because I didn't
have any new features.

I fully agree, and firmly believe that the current stabilisation works
incredibly well for shaking out bugs.  My problem is that it doesn't
work for stabilising features.  Either we have to get far more people
doing feature integration testing before the merge window, or we have to
accept feature updates after the merge window (for existing features
that are having stability issues).
