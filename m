  OK, so I've found time to follow-up on this. I've checked that
congestion_wait fixes Jens sent recently didn't change anything. Also I've
verified that backing out WRITE_SYNC related changes didn't help. Finally,
I've verified that when I back out all the changes that went to CFQ between
2.6.29 and 2.6.30 and the WRITE_SYNC changes, then the performance is back
to original values.
  Jens / Jeff, what to do next? I can try to bisect through CFQ changes but
that's going to be rather tedious and the result is uncertain since I
expect performance to jump up and down as various changes took place. So
I'd rather spend my time with something that has a higher chance to
succeed...
