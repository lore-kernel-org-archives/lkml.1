It appears this regression was introduced by commit
   edfaa7c36574f1bf09c65ad602412db9da5f96bf
   Driver core: convert block from raw kobjects to core devices

Previously, the device name "md_d0p1" would be parsed out as "md_d0"
and partition 1.
md_d0 would be found and the device number of the first partition
could then be deduced even though the partition table hadn't been
processed at this point, so 'p1' wasn't actually known.
The kernel would attempt to open 'p1', this would trigger a read of
the partition table and the open would be successful.

The new code is 'simpler'.  It doesn't try to parse the device name at
all.  It just compares the device name against the names of all known
devices.  As the partitions are not known at this time, md_d0p1 is not
found.

There seem to be two ways this could be fixed:
1/ restore the old behaviour of parsing out the partition information.
   This would be least likely to leave other regressions waiting to be
   found, but might be seen as somewhat ugly.

2/ Get md_d0 to read it's partition table earlier.  I've tried this
   before without much luck.
   There are three times that the partition table can be parsed.
   a/ When the device is opened if bd_invalidated is set.
   b/ When the device is first registered.  register_disk calls
      blkdev_get which effectively opens the device, thus triggering
      'a' above.
   c/ When the BLKRRPART ioctl is made on the device.

   When an md device is first registered, there are no disks attached
   to it, so no partition table can be read.  The way md devices get
   set up, they are registered as empty devices, the component devices
   are attached, then the array is 'started'.  Only at this point can
   data, such as the partition table, be read.  But this it too late
   for case 'b' above.  Case 'a' is the one that usually causes
   partitions to be read.  'mdadm' explicitly opens devices after
   creating them to trigger this.

   We could conceivably put a BLKRRPART call in at the end of
   autorun_array where the array has just been started, but that would
   be rather ugly.  We would need to open the device, and doing that
   inside the kernel is never clean.  The code in 'init/*.c' for that
   sort of thing creates nodes in /dev in a temporary root filesystem.
   We cannot do that for autorun_array as it can be call long after
   boot time (but the RAID_AUTODETECT ioctl) so there may not be 
   a temporary filesystem to play with.

So I currently think that restoring the old behaviour of not requiring
partitions to exist before trying to open them would be best.
