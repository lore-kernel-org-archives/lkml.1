FWIW, blktrace (I'm still on 2.6.31) is enlightening:

Total (xfs):
 Reads Queued:           4,       16KiB	 Writes Queued:     122,567,   10,485MiB

See "Writes Queued"  See also submit_bio() calls in xfs.

ext4 doing things a block at a time is certainly giving the elevator a workout...
I'd tend to chalk it up to that at first glance.
