The race is based on which thread removes the remaining
dirty inodes from the sb_s_dirty list - I don't think that is XFS
specific.

Right, which is why I want a custom ->do_sync method so I can
*guarantee* that sync works on XFS without fear breaking other
filesystems...

Ok.

Sure, that will be faster as long as the filesystems are on
separate devices.

As it is, once we have custom ->do_sync, XFS will probably grow
multiple threads per filesystem to sync AGs on independent spindles
in parallel.....

Right - that's exactly where we should be going with this, I think.
I'd suggest two callouts, perhaps: ->sync_data and ->sync_metadata.
The freeze code can then still operate in two stages, and we can
also use then for separating data and inode writeback in pdflush....

FWIW, I mentioned doing this sort of thing here:

http://xfs.org/index.php/Improving_inode_Caching#Avoiding_the_Generic_pdflush_Code

I think I'll look at redoing do_sync() to provide a custom sync
method before trying to fix XFS....

Cheers,

Dave.
