You're putting your box under astronomical load.  This is generally 
regarded as a bad idea, regardless of how well your storage controller 
is performing.  Can you measure the single-threaded throughput (say, 
coping one huge file, and then syncing) to give us a baseline 
performance figure?  rsync will happily peg your box, your network, and 
your cat if you let it.
