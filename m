But you don't actually print anything out in the module :)

Couldn't crypto_comp just call both alloc functions? I don't see
why we need a third function.

No, I mean that whether you want compression or decompression
is signified by the which function you're calling.  If you want
to do both then you call both.

Well with the netlink parameters these can have variable lengths
depending on how many parameters the user supplies.

Ah yes because crypto_comp is one of the original types that's
still built-in.  Because there are so few compression users and
algorithms (exactly 3 if you include null compression), I think
we can dispense with the compatibility stuff altogether since
we'll likely rip out fairly soon anyway.

So just create the new type, readd deflate using the new type
alongside the existing deflate algorithm.  The system is capable
of supporting two algorithms of the same name with different types.

Then once the other algorithm (lzo) is taken care of and all the
users are converted I'll just kill the old type and algorithms.

Cheers,
