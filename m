This flag is not necessary for the functionality, it's for efficiency.
I could take the "everytime checking" approach above, but I think
caching the busy state into the flag is more efficient, since:

  - The check function will be called from request stacking drivers
    frequently (e.g. request-based dm calls it everytime before
    an request is dispatched from the dm device.)

  - The scsi busy state checking needs queue lock and host lock
    even while the scsi busy state doesn't changed from the previous
    checking.

Actually, I don't get any performance problem by some simple testings
of the "everytime checking" approach.
Do you prefer the "everytime checking" approach to simplify the patch?

Thanks,
Kiyoshi Ueda
