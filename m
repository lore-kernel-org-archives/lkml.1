Yes, I would like to however when I take
ext4-patch-queue-70acdb9605784bd5c4b06e1a19761828a494a337.tar.gz (which is
the current ext4-patch-queue from http://repo.or.cz/w/ext4-patch-queue.git)
and apply those to linux-2.6.26-rc6 I get the following reject:


***************
*** 574,579 ****
   	INIT_LIST_HEAD(&ei->i_prealloc_list);
   	spin_lock_init(&ei->i_prealloc_lock);
   	jbd2_journal_init_jbd_inode(&ei->jinode, &ei->vfs_inode);
   	return &ei->vfs_inode;
   }

--- 574,584 ----
   	INIT_LIST_HEAD(&ei->i_prealloc_list);
   	spin_lock_init(&ei->i_prealloc_lock);
   	jbd2_journal_init_jbd_inode(&ei->jinode, &ei->vfs_inode);
+ 	ei->i_reserved_data_blocks = 0;
+ 	ei->i_reserved_meta_blocks = 0;
+ 	ei->i_allocated_meta_blocks = 0;
+ 	ei->i_delalloc_reserved_flag = 0;
+ 	spin_lock_init(&(ei->i_block_reservation_lock));
   	return &ei->vfs_inode;
   }

Which is from delalloc-ext4-ENOSPC-handling.patch. What am I doing wrong?
I could apply this by hand but I do not know if this would be correct.
Please can anyone advice what I need to do?

Thanks,
Holger
