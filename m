On google scale anvil lightning can fry your machine out of a clear sky.

However, there are still a few non-enterprise users out there, and knowing 
that specific usage patterns don't behave like they expect might be useful to 
them.

Actually, that's _exactly_ what he's talking about.

When writing to a degraded raid or a flash disk, journaling is essentially 
useless.  If you get a power failure, kernel panic, somebody tripping over a 
USB cable, and so on, your filesystem will not be protected by journaling.  
Your data won't be trashed _every_ time, but the likelihood is much greater 
than experience with journaling in other contexts would suggest.

Worse, the journaling may be counterproductive by _hiding_ many errors that 
fsck would promptly detect, so when the error is detected it may not be 
associated with the event that caused it.  It also may not be noticed until 
good backups of the data have been overwritten or otherwise cycled out.

You seem to be arguing that Linux is no longer used anywhere but the 
enterprise, so issues affecting USB flash keys or cheap software-only RAID 
aren't worth documenting?
