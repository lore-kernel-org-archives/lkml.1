You can try and revert it of course, but I think you are looking at the
wrong bits. If the segment counts were totally off, you'd never be
anywhere close to reaching the set limit. Your problems seems to be
missed contig segment merges.

Dummy approach - git log and grep for
9dfa52831e96194b8649613e3131baa2c109f7dc, then see what commit is before
that. Then do a git checkout commit.
