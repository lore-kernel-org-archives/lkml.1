I agree that majority of IOs are page cache reads/writes and they 
shouldn't be split.

It doesn't look crazy to me:

Case 1: the caller constructs a request to dm-io. Dm-io allocates its 
internal structure, splits the request into several bios, submits them, 
waits for them, calls the completion routing when they all finish.

Case 2: the caller constructs a big bio (without care about device 
limits), submits it to the block layer, the block layer splits the bio 
into several smaller bios (it doesn't even have to allocate the vector if 
it splits at page boundaries), submits the smaller bios to the device, 
when they finish, signals the completion of the big bio.

Now tell me, why do you think that "Case 1" is better than "Case 2"? If 
the bio gets split, you get exactly the same number of allocations in both 
cases. If the bio isn't split, "Case 2" is even better (it saves dm-io 
overhead).

If you increase code size in the interface, you make the interface more 
complex and any further changes will be harder. It kills the software 
slowly.

It may happen if you use stacked MD devices with different small stripe 
sizes. But it's not common because people usually set stripe size as a 
multiple of page size.
