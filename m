That would preserve the logical sequence of patches, yes.  However, Jens
is a bit pressed for time, so I agreed to do this in SCSI.

Unfortuantely, I still need the block tree for-next to be rebased up to
the current linus head because of a couple of conflicts:

CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in drivers/block/hd.c
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in drivers/block/mg_disk.c

The are both just rebase/rebase conflicts:  it looks like there are two
commit ids for

So they obviously moved into linus head but wasn't taken out of block
for-next.
