I see what is going on now... From the remount sync path, it's hitting:

        if (!down_read_trylock(&inode->i_sb->s_umount)) {
                requeue_io(inode);
                continue;
        }

in generic_sync_wb_inodes(), so it's not actually getting writing out
the dirty inodes for the remount.

do_remount()
        down_write(&sb->s_umount);
        do_remount_sb();
        sync_filesystem(sb);
                __sync_filesystem(sb, 0);
                __sync_filesystem(sb, 1);
                        sync_inodes_sb(sb, 1);
                                sync_sb_inodes(wbc);
                                        generic_sync_sb_inodes();

Jan, any ideas on how best to get around that?
