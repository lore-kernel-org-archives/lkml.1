OK. So the correct fix here should really be applied to fcntl_setlk().
There is absolutely no reason why we should be looping at all if the
filesystem has a ->lock() method.

In fact, this looping behaviour was introduced recently in commit
7723ec9777d9832849b76475b1a21a2872a40d20. Marc, Bruce, why was this
done, and how are filesystems now supposed to behave?
