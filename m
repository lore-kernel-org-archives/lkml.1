Yes ... otherwise you have to elongate the DEL interval from a few ms to
potentially anything.  That would allow locking a target in a dying
state and prevent any new LUNs being added.

As I've said several times, this could be done, but we'd have to audit
the code paths to make sure we allow for multiple same targets in the
list.

No, this is state model 101 ... you alter the state inside the lock and
call del outside of it.  Technically you're lying about the state for
the few us it takes to run out of the lock and del the target, but
there's a papal indulgence for that.
