I think it is better to fix fuse than to rewrite all the shutdown scripts.

I believe VFS should be rewritten here. Perhaps new "TASK_KILLABLE"
state can help?

I'm not saying fuse is worthless. It is a nice toy for single-user
systems. But I do not think we should be merging "allow ordinary users
to mount their own fuse's" before issues above are fixed.
