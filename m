umm, OK, that should work.

How does a stacking driver know that the backing_device which it is
looking at is a "lowest level" device?

I don't think it does - only the code which implements that device
knows this, so the stacking driver has to call into that device's
congested_fn(), yes?

In which case one wonders why the state was stored in the
backing_dev_info at all.  Why not store it in the device-private data
to avoid confusion and abuse?

iirc, BDI_read/write_congested predated the introduction of the
congested_fn() and perhaps should have been removed once we went to the
congested_fn approach.  But it's been a while since I spent a lot of
time looking in there.

Something along those lines, sure.

hm, OK.
