Yes.  There are some limits to what can be put into CommandList_struct
directly, but there is also scatter gather chaining, in which we use
the last element in the CommandList_struct to point to another buffer
of SG entries.

If you have a system with a lot of controllers, having a large number of 
scatter gathers can be a bit of a memory hog, and since this memory is all
via pci_alloc_consistent, that can be a concern.  It would be nice if
there was a way for the user to specify differing amounts of scatter
gathers for different controller instances so for instance the controller
which he's running his big oracle database, or webserver or whatever on
gets lots, while the controller he's booted from that's mostly idle
gets not so many.  I don't know what a good way for a user to identify
what controller he's talking about in a module parameter would be 
though.  Maybe by pci domain/bus/device/function?  Maybe something along
the lines of:

	modprobe hpsa dev1=0:0e:00.0 sg1=1000 dev2=0:0b:00.0 sg2=31

to say that one controller gets 1000 scatter gather elements, but
another gets only 31.  But PCI busses can change if hardware 
configuration changes, and this isn't exactly obvious, so seems less
than ideal.  Any bright ideas on that front?

We have some specialized versions of cciss around that have variable
sized SG arrays in CommandList_struct as well as doing scatter gather
chaining (not to be confused with the scatter gather chaining concept
in the scsi mid layer.)

There was some other discussion about pushing this sort of thing to 
upper layers, using a tag generated in the scsi layer as a means
of allocating driver command buffers, since, presumably there's a
one to one mapping.  (I didn't completely grok it all though.)
