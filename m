  Thanks for explanation. But you can always immediately return from
get_block() when you see that buffer has buffer_delay() set if you do not
want to do an allocation from there (e.g. in ext3 I want to do an allocation
in such case for compatibility reasons but that's a separate story).
  Alternatively, if the get_block() call + immediate return bothers you, we
could introduce something like AOP_FLAG_DELALLOC and make
__block_prepare_write call get_block only if buffer is !mapped and !delay
when this flag is set. IMO that would be probably the best. What do you
think?
