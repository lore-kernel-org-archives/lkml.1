+Linux block-backed filesystems can only work correctly when several
+conditions are met in the block layer and below (disks, flash
+cards). Some of them are obvious ("data on media should not change
+randomly"), some are less so.
+
+Write errors not allowed (NO-WRITE-ERRORS)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Writes to media never fail. Even if disk returns error condition
+during write, filesystems can't handle that correctly, because success
+on fsync was already returned when data hit the journal.
+
+	Fortunately writes failing are very uncommon on traditional 
+	spinning disks, as they have spare sectors they use when write
+	fails.
+
+Sector writes are atomic (ATOMIC-SECTORS)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Either whole sector is correctly written or nothing is written during
+powerfail.
+
+	Unfortunately, none of the cheap USB/SD flash cards I've seen
+	do behave like this, and are thus unsuitable for all Linux
+	filesystems I know.
+
+		An inherent problem with using flash as a normal block
+		device is that the flash erase size is bigger than
+		most filesystem sector sizes.  So when you request a
+		write, it may erase and rewrite some 64k, 128k, or
+		even a couple megabytes on the really _big_ ones.
+
+		If you lose power in the middle of that, filesystem
+		won't notice that data in the "sectors" _around_ the
+		one your were trying to write to got trashed.
+
+	Because RAM tends to fail faster than rest of system during 
+	powerfail, special hw killing DMA transfers may be necessary;
+	otherwise, disks may write garbage during powerfail.
+	Not sure how common that problem is on generic PC machines.
+
+	Note that atomic write is very hard to guarantee for RAID-4/5/6,
+	because it needs to write both changed data, and parity, to 
+	different disks. UPS for RAID array should help.

 Journaling
-----------
-
-A journaling extension to the ext2 code has been developed by Stephen
-Tweedie.  It avoids the risks of metadata corruption and the need to
-wait for e2fsck to complete after a crash, without requiring a change
-to the on-disk ext2 layout.  In a nutshell, the journal is a regular
-file which stores whole metadata (and optionally data) blocks that have
-been modified, prior to writing them into the filesystem.  This means
-it is possible to add a journal to an existing ext2 filesystem without
-the need for data conversion.
-
-When changes to the filesystem (e.g. a file is renamed) they are stored in
-a transaction in the journal and can either be complete or incomplete at
-the time of a crash.  If a transaction is complete at the time of a crash
-(or in the normal case where the system does not crash), then any blocks
-in that transaction are guaranteed to represent a valid filesystem state,
-and are copied into the filesystem.  If a transaction is incomplete at
-the time of the crash, then there is no guarantee of consistency for
-the blocks in that transaction so they are discarded (which means any
-filesystem changes they represent are also lost).
