Clear.

Unfortunately, I think, with absolute BW limits at a certain point, if
we hit the limit, we need to block the IO request. That's the same
either, when we dispatch or submit the request. And the risk is to break
the logic of the IO priorities and fall in the classic priority
inversion problem.

The difference is that probably working at the CFQ level gives a better
control so we can handle these cases appropriately and avoid the
priority inversion problems.
