This is a case where the improved IPA-CP (interprocedural constant propagation)
of GCC 4.4 may help.  In general GCC cannot say how a call argument may
affect optimization if the function was inlined, so the size estimates are done
with just looking at the function body, not the arguments (well, for
GCC 4.4 this
is not completely true, there is now some "heuristics").  With IPA-CP GCC will
clone the function for the constant arguments, optimize it and eventually inline
it if it is small enough.  At the moment this happens only if all
callers call the
function with the same constant though (at least I think so).

The above is definitely one case where using a macro or forced inlining is
a better idea than to trust a compiler to figure out that it can optimize the
function to a size suitable for inlining if called with a constant parameter.

Because it's a hard problem, it's not stupid to fail here - you didn't tell the
compiler the function optimizes!

Experience tells us that people do not know better.  Maybe the kernel is
an exception here, but generally trusting "inline" up to an absolute is
a bad idea (we stretch heuristics if you specify "inline" though).  We can,
for the kernels purpose and maybe other clever developers, invent a
-fobey-inline mode, only inline functions marked inline and inline
all of them (if possible - which would be the key difference to always_inline).

But would you still want small functions be inlined even if they are not
marked inline?

Use -fno-inline-functions-called-once then.  But if you ask for -Os you get -Os.
Also recent GCC estimate and limit stack growth - which you can tune
reliably with --param large-stack-frame-growth and --param large-stack-frame.

Static makes inlining a single call cheap, because the out-of-line body
can be reclaimed.  If you do not like that, turn it off.

They do - just constant arguments are obviously not used for optimizing
before inlining.  Otherwise you'd scream bloody murder at us for all the
increase in compile-time ;)
