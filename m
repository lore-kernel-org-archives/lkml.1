I agree with the whole write up outside of the above - degraded RAID 
does meet this requirement unless you have a second (or third, counting 
the split write) failure during the rebuild.

Note that the window of exposure during a RAID rebuild is linear with 
the size of your disk and how much you detune the rebuild...
