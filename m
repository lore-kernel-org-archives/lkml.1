Point of thread: Two problems, mentioned in detail below, NCQ in Linux 
when used in a RAID configuration and two, something with how Linux 
interacts with the drives causes lots of problems as when I run the WD 
tools on the disks, they do not show any errors.

If anyone has/would like me to run any debugging/patches/etc on this 
system feel free to suggest/send me things to try out.  After I put the 
VR's in a test system, I left NCQ enabled and I made a 10 disk raid5 to 
see how fast I could get it to fail, I ran bonnie++ shown below as a disk 
benchmark/stress test:

For the next test I will repeat this one but with NCQ disabled, having NCQ 
enabled makes it fail very easily.  Then I want to re-run the test with 
RAID6.

bonnie++ -d /r1/test -s 1000G -m p63 -n 16:100000:16:64

$ df -h
/dev/md3              2.5T  5.5M  2.5T   1% /r1

And the results?  Two disk "failures" according to md/Linux within a few 
hours as shown below:

Note, the NCQ-related errors are what I talk about all of the time, if you use
NCQ and Linux in a RAID environment with WD drives, well-- good luck.

Two-disks failed out of the RAID5 and I currentlty cannot even 'see' one 
of the drives with smartctl, will reboot the host and check sde again.

After a reboot, it comes up and has no errors, really makes one wonder 
where/what the bugs is/are, there are two I can see:
1. NCQ issue on at least WD drives in Linux in SW md/RAID
2. Velociraptor/other disks reporting all kinds of sector errors etc, but 
when you use the WD 11.x disk tools program and run all of their tests it 
says the disks have no problems whatsoever!  The smart statistics do 
confirm this.  Currently, TLER is on for all disks, for the duration of 
these tests.

The other drive that blew out:
p63:~# mdadm --assemble /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 /dev/sde1 /dev/sdf1 /dev/sdg1 
/dev/sdh1 /dev/sdi1 /dev/sdj1 /dev/sdk1 /dev/sdl1
mdadm: cannot open device /dev/sdl1: No such file or directory
mdadm: /dev/sdl1 has no superblock - assembly aborted

Smartctl open device: /dev/sdl failed: No such file or directory

It is not even coming up, power cycling the host is required to 'fix' the 
drive:
p63:~# init 0

A few minutes later after a power cycle now its back:

The use of NCQ is VERY dangerous in WD drives in Linux IMO if it requires a
power cycle to get the drive working again, and of course, all of the SMART
statistics show no problems.

p63:~# mdadm --assemble /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 /dev/sde1 /dev/sdf1 /dev/sdg1 /dev/sdh1 /dev/sdi1 /dev/sdj1 /dev/sdk1 /dev/sdl1
mdadm: /dev/sdc1 assembled from 7 drives and 1 spare - not enough to start the array.

Glad this was only a test array.

I was able to reboot to get this disk working again (below,sde) but had to 
power cycle to get /dev/sdl working:

# smartctl -a /dev/sde

A mandatory SMART command failed: exiting. To continue, add one or more '-T permissive' options.

What did the RAID5 look like after it failed everywhere?
