I see, so we're talking about two different layers here.  At least at
the block layer, there's nothing like partial failure.  I highly doubt
it would work with buffer bouncing and etc.  A failed request is a
failed request.  It may have sense request but doesn't have any
meaningful actual data.

Umm... If it's going through block layer, it should be split in such a
way that the initial partial part is completed successuflly and then
the latter part fails when re-issued.  Not sure whether that would be
possible for your code tho.

I'm not sure the said code is safe with regard to buffer bouncing and
all.

IIUC, it's undefined at the block layer, well, at least till now and
it working for your code could just be dumb luck (bouncing not
happened or data transfer direction is to device or whatever).

So, basically, your code which depends on residual count on failure is
broken.  :-(

Thanks.
