SLAB and SLUB support calling ksize() on objects returned by
kmem_cache_alloc.

SLOB only supports it on objects from kmalloc. This is because it does
not store any size or type information in kmem_cache_alloc'ed objects.
Instead, it infers them from the cache argument.

Ideally SLAB and SLUB would complain about using ksize inappropriately
when debugging was enabled.
