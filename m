Because the NFS/SCST servers are running RAID?

Also the client side NFS/SCST IO request may be slitted up and served
by a pool of server processes, which introduces the same disorderness
as in RAID configuration. But I wonder whether blk_* work for them,
or NFS/SCST have the "plug" concept at all.

Yup, the "#ifdef CONFIG_BLOCK" looks ugly..
