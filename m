Not having a suggestion for redrawing the boundaries is a problem of the
paradigm.  Right at the moment using OSD is an all or nothing, there's
no migration path for block based filesystems, or even a good idea how
they'd take advantage of OSD.  Most OSD based filesystems are for
special purpose things (mainly cluster FS).

No ... by mapping I mean mapping of VFS functions.

For example, an OSD filesystem should be user mountable: if the user has
the security key (could possibly do this in userspace).  Additionally,
an OSD with attributes should be pluggable into the VFS layer
sufficiently to allow attribute search, even if the VFS has no idea of
the metadata layout, we can still get objects back.  We'd also better be
able to do backup and restore of object based devices.

The basic problem for OSD, at least as I see it is that unless it can
provide some compelling relevance to current filesystem problems (like
attribute search is 10x faster over OSD vs block or X filesystem gets a
2x performance improvement using OSD vs block ...) it's doomed forever
to be a niche player: nice idea but no relevance to the real world.

OK ... perhaps I missed the description of how a general purpose
filesystem might use this then?

Um, your submission path is character.  You pick up block again because
SCSI uses it for queues, but it's not really part of your paradigm.

But that's precisely the problem:  "OSD based filesystems" implying that
if you want to use OSD you write a new filesystem.

OK, so this is moving it more towards general usability.

It's an indicator of one.  If you buy my premise that OSD cannot be
relevant without compelling user cases, then the lack of a user API can
be viewed as a symptom of this.

Right, so I'm reasonably happy to accept libosd for what it is:  an
enabler for a few specialised applications. 

I think your choice of using a character device will turn out to be a
design mistake because the migration path of existing filesystems is
bound to be a block device with extra features (which they may or may
not make use of) but only if there's a way to make ODS relevant to
users.
