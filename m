One note... This is actually causing some new compile warnings to be
spit out, varies from arch to arch, dependent on page size... ppc64
with 64k pages is the worst offender:

crypto/testmgr.c: In function 'test_nhash':
crypto/testmgr.c:194: warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type
crypto/testmgr.c: In function 'test_aead':

crypto/testmgr.c:375: warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type
