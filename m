Certainly with the overall creds work.  I haven't looked in
creds-next-subsys yet to see if it conflicts.  I'll go ahead and port
later this week or early next.

creds-next-subsys is not yet feeding into linux-next, right?  So I
should wait until they hit linux-next?

(It makes more sense for me to port userns on top of creds than for
David to port creds on top of my patches anyway.  I'm actually a bit
afraid that my refcounting will be complicated by struct creds, but
we'll see)
