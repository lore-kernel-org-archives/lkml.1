Yes, we shouldn't be needlessly raising the bar for power users.

Agreed, and actually not fixing Kconfig UI problems will make the other
issues being fixed *slower* (because they result in *increased* workload
on developers' side).

This is why nowadays IDE DMA support is automatically selected by IDE
host drivers that need it - a big relief for everybody.

not be discouraged to work on these problems...
