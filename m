	Only that, if you're trying to keep the interface human readable, then
having too many names for things (states and transitions) can make the
interface less than intuitive. Doesn't look like that's an issue for the
above state machine though so I think you're right -- a single file with
transitions encoded as states seems best.

Thanks for the explanation of the states.
