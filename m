This looks very reasonable, with some minor comments below.
Could you please also include a patch for ext4.  Also, Andrew prefers that
the patches for ext2/ext3/ext4 are in separate emails.

How the struct is allocated seems like an implementation detail that doesn't
belong in blockgroup_lock.h at all, because "sb" is not "struct superblock"
but rather "struct ext[23]_sb_info".  In fact, changing this without also
patching ext4 would cause ext4 to break.

I would suggest to change this to take the s_blockgroup_lock as a parameter,

#define bgl_lock_ptr(bgl, block_group)
	(bgl->locks[(block_group) & (NR_BG_LOCKS - 1)].lock)

and then in ext[234]_fs_sb.h add a new helper in the same (first) patch:

#define sb_bgl_lock(sbi, block_group)
	bgl_lock_ptr(&sbi->s_blockgroup_lock, block_group)

and remove sb_bgl_lock() from blockgroup_lock.h entirely.  As part of the
later patches to change the s_blockgroup_lock allocations for each of
ext[234] this changes in ext[234]_fs_sb.h to:

#define sb_bgl_lock(sbi, block_group)
	bgl_lock_ptr(sbi->s_blockgroup_lock, block_group)


This allows each of the later patches to be landed separately without
breaking the build.

Cheers, Andreas
