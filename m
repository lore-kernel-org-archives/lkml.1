Are you saying that users who need an efficient iSCSI implementation
should switch to OpenSolaris ? The OpenSolaris COMSTAR project involves
the migration of the existing OpenSolaris iSCSI target daemon from
userspace to their kernel. The OpenSolaris developers are
spending time on this because they expect a significant performance
improvement.

My measurements on a 1 GB/s InfiniBand network have shown that the current
SCST implementation is able to read data via direct I/O at a rate of 811 GB/s
(via SRP) and that the current STGT implementation is able to transfer data at a
rate of 589 MB/s (via iSER). That's a performance difference of 38%.

And even more important, the I/O latency of SCST is significantly
lower than that
of STGT. This is very important for database workloads -- the I/O pattern caused
by database software is close to random I/O, and database software needs low
latency I/O in order to run efficiently.

In the thread with the title "Performance of SCST versus STGT" on the
SCST-devel /
STGT-devel mailing lists not only the raw performance numbers were discussed but
also which further performance improvements are possible. It became clear that
the SCST performance can be improved further by implementing a well known
optimization (zero-copy I/O). Fujita Tomonori explained in the same
thread that it is
possible to improve the performance of STGT further, but that this would require
a lot of effort (implementing asynchronous I/O in the kernel and also
implementing
a new caching mechanism using pre-registered buffers).
