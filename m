this should be a easy fix. start tgtd, get port setup ready in forked
process, then signal its parent that ready to quit. or set port ready in
parent, fork and pass to daemon.

this is another easy fix. tgtd started with unconfigured status and then
a tgtadm can configure it and turn it into ready status.


those are really minor usability issue. ( i know it is painful for user,
i agree)


the major problem here is to discuss in architectural wise, which one is
better... linux kernel should have one implementation that is good from
foundation...
