Of course I can do that. That will result in 1 target and 128 lun
for st_yosemite and 128 target and 1 lun for st_vsc. That seems
a little weird and I am afraid it will be turned down. Also
I can keep a same mapping for the console in the original code.

If you think it's ok, that's really better, because it makes the
hot path a bit faster. Also because of the CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN
option, I have to map lun to channel otherwise many entities
will disappear when that option is not selected. Plus I have to
reserve a slot for the RAID console, so the final mapping may be:

channel:0~7, id:0~16(st_shasta, channel 0,id 16 is reserved for console)
channel:0~127, id:0~1(st_yosemite, channel 0,id 1 is reserved for
console)
channel:0, id:0~128(st_vsc, channel 0,id 128 is reserved for console)

I don't know whether this is acceptable.
