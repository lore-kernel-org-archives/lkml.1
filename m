OK, so I don't see a huge distinction here.  This is a driver for a
piece of enterprise HW that Linux previously didn't support.  To someone
cursing not being able to use there hardware, it's every bit as
important as the latest wireless driver.

While the exemption exists, I can certainly ignore the merge window for
new drivers, yes ... however, that's not 50% of the code submitted in
the merge window, and it's one time ... the same driver follows the
merge window for the next release.  I try to police this pretty rigidly
in SCSI ... as you do at the top.

In fact, for SCSI, these two drivers are the third and fourth merge
window exemptions in our year long history of allowing this.

OK, so on the policy, let me argue against the above.  One of the things
we've been saying about linux is that we facilitate rapid adoption of
new hardware (and that we support more hardware than any other OS).  The
Merge window exemption was adopted at the kernel summit last year
specifically to speed our adoption of new hardware.  I think it's
valuable for this speed of adoption to be *all* hardware, not
specifically mass market laptop type stuff.

However, even if you want to change the definition, can we please not do
it retroactively?

Thanks,

James
