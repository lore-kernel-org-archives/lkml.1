  Hmm, this patch definitely does something important because without it I
hit corruption in UML in ~20 minutes and with it no corruption happens
in ~3 hours. Maybe someone calls set_page_dirty() on the page and
__set_page_dirty_buffers() unconditionally dirties all the buffers the
page has? But I still don't see how the write could be lost which is what
I observe in fsx-linux test. I'm doing some more tests to understand this
better.
