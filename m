Martin,

I've backported Peter's perbdi patchset to 2.6.22.x.  I can share it
with anyone who might be interested.

As expected, it has yielded 2.6.24-rcX level scaling.  Given the test
result matrix you previously posted, 2.6.22.x+perbdi might give you
what you're looking for (sans improved writeback that 2.6.24 was
thought to be providing).  That is, much improved scaling with better
O_DIRECT and network throughput.  Just a thought...

Unfortunately, my priorities (and computing resources) have shifted
and I won't be able to thoroughly test Fengguang's new writeback patch
on 2.6.24-rc8... whereby missing out on providing
justification/testing to others on _some_ improved writeback being
included in 2.6.24 final.

Not to mention the window for writeback improvement is all but closed
considering the 2.6.24-rc8 announcement's 2.6.24 final release
timetable.

regards,
Mike
