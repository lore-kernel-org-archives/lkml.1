I don't worry about anything. I just think that these round_jiffies_up
are pointless because they were added for the block-layer users that
care about exact timeouts, however the block-layer doesn't export
blk_add_timer() so the block-layer users can't control the exact time
when the timer starts. So doing round_jiffies_up calculation per every
request doesn't make sense for me.

Anyway, it's trivial. If you like these round_jiffies_up, it's fine by
me.
