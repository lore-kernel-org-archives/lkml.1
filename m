why should linux as an iSCSI target be limited to passthrough to a SCSI 
device.

the most common use of this sort of thing that I would see is to load up a 
bunch of 1TB SATA drives in a commodity PC, run software RAID, and then 
export the resulting volume to other servers via iSCSI. not a 'real' SCSI 
device in sight.

As far as how good a standard iSCSI is, at this point I don't think it 
really matters. There are too many devices and manufacturers out there 
that implement iSCSI as their storage protocol (from both sides, offering 
storage to other systems, and using external storage). Sometimes the best 
technology doesn't win, but Linux should be interoperable with as much as 
possible and be ready to support the winners and the loosers in technology 
options, for as long as anyone chooses to use the old equipment (after 
all, we support things like Arcnet networking, which lost to Ethernet many 
years ago)
