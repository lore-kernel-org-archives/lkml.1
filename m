With the kind help of:
    Joerg Dorchain: <joerg@dorchain.net>
    Jon Chelton <jchelton@ffpglobal.com>
    Stefan Priebe <s.priebe@allied-internet.ag>

Which let me take up their machines their effort and their time
I hope I'm able to fix the gdth driver for the 2.6.24 kernel and forward.
Actually it was a simple miss by Christoph, but with my inexperience
it took me a bisection and a while to get it.

Both Joerg, and Stefan where able to boot with these patches and work
on their machine. Jon Chelton's disks array should also work, we're testing.

Submitted 2 patches. They should also be included after some testing
into the 2.6.24.x stable releases. (Will be posted after some more testing)

[PATCH 1/2] gdth: scan for scsi devices
 simple but must fatal.

[PATCH 2/2] gdth: bugfix for the Timer at exit crash
  James please inspect and comment on this patch. It was not yet tested
  by the original bug submitter.

In the original gdth series Christoph has forgotten to add the call to
scsi_scan_host(). Jeff alternative patches did do the scan. After everything
was probed, the code would loop on all found cards and scan. However I like
to individually scan at each probe, because I think this way it is more ready
for the hot-plug API where the discovery is done outside of the driver, and the
probe is called on single host at a time. Is that right? please comment.

Test away.

Meany thanks to Joerg, Jon && Stefan, Cheers.

Boaz
