I forget my reasons for that - would need to go back and review the
discussions when the patch was first merged.

One of the above patches (I forget which) breaks the build because it
expects the presence of Al Viro's VFS tree, and that hasn't been merged
yet.  I need to wait and see if that merge will be happening (seems
unlikely) and if not, rework the patch against mainline.

Quie a few patches (5%?) tend to get delayed like this due to missing
dependencies.
