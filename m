Your last sentence does not make sense:

According to your timeline btrfs 1.0 will be released in Q408 [1] - and
the merge window for 2.6.29 will be in Q109.

One risk you should be aware of is that when btrfs is in 2.6.29 part of 
the Linux press might pick it up and stress test and benchmark this new 
filesystem.

JFS still suffers from from not being that good when it was
initially merged.
