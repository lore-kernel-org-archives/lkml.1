The thing to remember is that sym2 is in transition from being a dual
BSD/Linux driver to being a purely Linux driver.  I know, it's been more
than two years, and I'm still not done.

My latest thing I'm looking at fixing is to make Scsi_Host very
much the primary entity in the sym2 driver, and leave just the
device/scripts-accessible stuff in the hcb.

Fine by me.  Do you have the ability to produce failures on a whim on
your platforms?  I've been vaguely musing a PCI device failure patch for
x86, just so people can test driver failure paths.

eh_wait (when I removed it) contained a completion ... I think it used
to be a semaphore, some time before 2.6.12

Let's leave it with a completion for now.  I think it works out more
efficiently in the end.
