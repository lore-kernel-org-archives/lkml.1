So this is essentially the same as "punch".  There doesn't seem to be
a mechanism to only unallocate unused FA_{PRE,}ALLOCATE space at the
end.

This also seems to be a bit of a wart, since it isn't a natural converse
of either of the above functions.  How about having two modes,
similar to FA_ALLOCATE and FA_PREALLOCATE?  Say, FA_PUNCH (which
would be as you describe here - deletes all data in the specified
range changing the file size if it overlaps EOF, and FA_DEALLOCATE,
which only deallocates unused FA_{PRE,}ALLOCATE space?

We might also consider making @mode be a mask instead of an enumeration:

FA_FL_DEALLOC	0x01 (default allocate)
FA_FL_KEEP_SIZE	0x02 (default extend/shrink size)
FA_FL_DEL_DATA	0x04 (default keep written data on DEALLOC)

We might then build FA_ALLOCATE and FA_DEALLOCATE out of these flags
without making the interface sub-optimal.

I suppose it might be a bit late in the game to add a "goal"
parameter and e.g. FA_FL_REQUIRE_GOAL, FA_FL_NEAR_GOAL, etc to make
the API more suitable for XFS?  The goal could be a single __u64, or
a struct with e.g. __u64 byte offset (possibly also __u32 lun like
in FIEMAP).  I guess the one potential limitation here is the
number of function parameters on some architectures.

Should probably say whether space is removed on failure or not.  In
some (primitive) implementations it might no longer be possible to
distinguish between unwritten extents and zero-filled blocks, though
at this point DEALLOC of zero-filled blocks might not be harmful either.
