Your patch fixes the build error, but I'm not sure whether it's the
correct fix:

CONFIG_SCSI_SAS_LIBSAS=y, CONFIG_FW_LOADER=m, CONFIG_SCSI_AIC94XX=m
will now pass all randconfig tests, but the effects of the
"select FW_LOADER" in the SCSI_AIC94XX driver would be lost in this 
configuration, and we might get bug reports like "driver works built-in 
but fails with 'No SAS Address provided for %s\n' when built modular."

IMHO SCSI_SAS_LIBSAS should simply select FW_LOADER.
