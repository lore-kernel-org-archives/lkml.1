Yes if the feature group had existed, that would have been a good
option. 

Don't take me wrong. I agree with this group direction. Most 
namespaces can't be safely decoupled from each other with a clone 
flag.

I'm never sure ! :) That's what we have in plan for the moment.

No magic there. but running a container will require some userland code 
to be set up properly.

well, CLONE_STOPPED is being recycle in 2.6.26. so we could use that one
to group namespaces.

and CLONE_NEWPID would probably be a good candidate to group namespaces.

That would be fine for me but it would still leave clone with one to zero
flags left. 

Thanks,
