    [XFS] eagerly remove vmap mappings to avoid upsetting Xen
    
    XFS leaves stray mappings around when it vmaps memory to make it virtually
    contigious. This upsets Xen if one of those pages is being recycled into a
    pagetable, since it finds an extra writable mapping of the page.
    
    This patch solves the problem in a brute force way, by making XFS always
    eagerly unmap its mappings.

    [XFS] no longer using io_vnode, as was remaining from 23 cherrypick
    
    Because we cherrypicked SGI-Modid xfs-linux-melb:xfs-kern:29675a
    and it depended on the sgi mod which removed io_vnode (which was
    not cherrypicked in 23) it was hand modified.
    This fixes things back up (to the originial mod) now we have moved
    on again.

    [XFS] avoid race in sync_inodes() that can fail to write out all dirty data
    
    In xfs_fs_sync_super() treat a sync the same as a filesystem freeze. This
    is needed to force the log to disk for inodes which are not marked dirty
    in the Linux inode (the inodes are marked dirty on completion of the log
    I/O) and so sync_inodes() will not flush them.
    
    In xfs_fs_write_inode() a synchronous flush will not get an EAGAIN from
    xfs_inode_flush() and if an asynchronous flush returns EAGAIN we should
    pass it on to the caller. If we get an error while flushing the inode then
    re-dirty it so we can try again later.

    [XFS] This fix prevents bulkstat from spinning in an infinite loop.
    
    Here 'agino' increments through the inodes in an allocation group. At the
    end of the innermost 'for' loop it will hold the value of the next inode
    to look at (ie the first inode in the next cluster/chunk). Assigning
    'lastino' to 'agino' resets it to the last inode in the last inode cluster
    we just looked at. This causes us to look up the very same cluster and
    examine all the inodes all over again, and again, and again...
    
    We also want to set 'lastino' for the cases when we're not interested in
    the inode so that the next call to bulkstat won't re-examine the same
    uninteresting inodes.

    [XFS] get_bulkall() could return incorrect inode state
    
    In the following scenario xfs_bulkstat() returns incorrect stale inode
    state:
    
    1. File_A is created and its inode synced to disk. 2. File_A is unlinked
    and doesn't exist anymore. 3. Filesystem sync is invoked. 4. File_B is
    created. File_B happens to reclaim File_A's inode. 5. xfs_bulkstat() is
    called and detects File_B but reports the
    
    incorrect File_A inode state.
    
    Explanation for the incorrect inode state is that inodes are not
    immediately synced on file create for performance reasons. This leaves the
    on-disk inode buffer uninitialized (or with old state from a previous
    generation inode) and this is what xfs_bulkstat() would report.
    
    The patch marks the on-disk inode buffer "dirty" on unlink. When the inode
    is reclaimed (by a new file create), xfs_bulkstat() would filter this
    inode by the "dirty" mark. Once the inode is flushed to disk, the on-disk
    buffer "dirty" mark is automatically removed and a following
    xfs_bulkstat() would return the correct inode state.
    
    Marking the on-disk inode buffer "dirty" on unlink is achieved by setting
    the on-disk di_nlink field to 0. Note that the in-core di_nlink has
    already been set to 0 and a corresponding transaction logged by
    xfs_droplink(). This is an exception from the rule that any on-disk inode
    buffer changes has to be followed by a disk write (inode flush).
    Synchronizing the in-core to on-disk di_nlink values in advance (before
    the actual inode flush to disk) should be fine in this case because the
    inode is already unlinked and it would never change its di_nlink again for
    this inode generation.

    [XFS] ensure file size is logged on synchronous writes
    
    Synchronous writes currently log inode changes before syncing pages to
    disk. Since the file size is updated on I/O completion we wont be writing
    out the updated file size and if we crash the file will have the wrong
    size. This change moves the logging after the syncing of the pages to
    ensure we log the correct file size.

    [XFS] do not have XFSMNT_IDELETE as default when mounted with XFSMNT_DMAPI
    
    XFS inodes are dynamically allocated on demand, rather than being
    allocated at mkfs time. Chunks of 64 inodes are allocated at once, but
    they are never freed. Over time, this can lead to filesystem
    fragmentation, clusters of inodes and the btrees which point at them can
    be scattered around the system.
    
    By freeing clusters as they are emptied, we will reduce fragmentation of
    the free space after removing files. This in turn will allow us to make
    better placement decisions when repopulating a filesystem. The
    XFSMNT_IDELETE mount option enables freeing clusters when they get empty.
    
    Unfortunately a side effect of freeing inode clusters is that the inode
    generation numbers of such inodes would be reset to zero when the cluster
    is reclaimed. This is a problem in particular for a DMAPI enabled
    filesystem as the the DMAPI handles need to be unique and persistent in
    time. An unique DMAPI handle is built with the help of the inode
    generation number. When the last one is prematurely reset by an inode
    cluster reclaim, there is a high probability of different generation
    inodes to end up having identical DMAPI handles.
    
    To avoid the problem with identical DMAPI handles, the XFSMNT_IDELETE
    mount option should be set as default, only if the filesystem is not
    mounted with XFSMNT_DMAPI.

    [XFS] Radix tree based inode caching
    
    One of the perpetual scaling problems XFS has is indexing it's incore
    inodes. We currently uses hashes and the default hash sizes chosen can
    only ever be a tradeoff between memory consumption and the maximum
    realistic size of the cache.
    
    As a result, anyone who has millions of inodes cached on a filesystem
    needs to tunes the size of the cache via the ihashsize mount option to
    allow decent scalability with inode cache operations.
    
    A further problem is the separate inode cluster hash, whose size is based
    on the ihashsize but is smaller, and so under certain conditions (sparse
    cluster cache population) this can become a limitation long before the
    inode hash is causing issues.
    
    The following patchset removes the inode hash and cluster hash and
    replaces them with radix trees to avoid the scalability limitations of the
    hashes. It also reduces the size of the inodes by 3 pointers....

    [XFS] use filldir internally
    
    Currently xfs has a rather complicated internal scheme to allow for
    different directory formats in IRIX. This patch rips all code related to
    this out and pushes useage of the Linux filldir callback into the lowlevel
    directory code. This does not make the code any less portable because
    filldir can be used to create dirents of all possible variations
    (including the IRIX ones as proved by the IRIX binary emulation code under
    arch/mips/).
    
    This patch get rid of an unessecary copy in the readdir path, about 400
    lines of code and one of the last two users of the uio structure.
    
    This version is updated to deal with dmapi aswell which greatly simplifies
    the get_dirattrs code. The dmapi part has been tested using the
    get_dirattrs tools from the xfstest dmapi suite1 with various small and
    large directories.

    [XFS] superblock endianess annotations
    
    Creates a new xfs_dsb_t that is __be annotated and keeps xfs_sb_t for the
    incore one. xfs_xlatesb is renamed to xfs_sb_to_disk and only handles the
    incore -> disk conversion. A new helper xfs_sb_from_disk handles the other
    direction and doesn't need the slightly hacky table-driven approach
    because we only ever read the full sb from disk.
    
    The handling of shared r/o filesystems has been buggy on little endian
    system and fixing this required shuffling around of some code in that
    area.

    [XFS] dinode endianess annotations
    
    Biggest bit is duplicating the dinode structure so we have one annotated for
    native endianess and one for disk endianess. The other significant change
    is that xfs_xlate_dinode_core is split into one helper per direction to
    allow for proper annotations, everything else is trivial.
    
    As a sidenode splitting out the incore dinode means we can move it into
    xfs_inode.h in a later patch and severely improving on the include hell in
    xfs.

    [XFS] Fix a potential NULL pointer deref in XFS on failed mount.
    
    If we fail to open the the log device buftarg, we can fall through to
    error handling code that fails to check for a NULL log device buftarg
    before calling xfs_free_buftarg().
    
    This patch fixes the issue by checking mp->m_logdev_targp against NULL in
    xfs_unmountfs_close() and doing the proper xfs_blkdev_put(logdev); and
    xfs_blkdev_put(rtdev); on (!mp->m_rtdev_targp) in xfs_mount().
    
    Discovered by the Coverity checker.

    [XFS] choose single default logbuf count & size
    
    Remove sizing of logbuf size & count based on physical memory; this was
    never a very good gauge as it's looking at global memory, but deciding on
    sizing per-filesystem; no account is made of the total number of
    filesystems, for example.
    
    For now just take the largest "default" case, as was set for machines with
    >400MB - 8 x 32k buffers. This can always be tuned higher or lower with
    mount options if necessary. Removes one more user of xfs_physmem.

    [XFS] cleanup defintions of BMBT_*BITLEN macros
    
    The BMBT_*BITLEN are currently defined in a complicated way depending on
    XFS_NATIVE_HOST. But if all the macros are expanded they (obviously)
    expand to the same value for both cases.
    
    This patch defines the macros in the most simple way and updates the
    comment describing them to remove outdated bits.

    xfs_bmbt_set_all/xfs_bmbt_disk_set_all are identical to
    xfs_bmbt_set_allf/xfs_bmbt_disk_set_allf except that the former take a
    xfs_bmbt_irec_t and the latter take the individual extent fields as scalar

    wrappers around xfs_bmbt_set_allf/xfs_bmbt_disk_set_allf and cleans up the
    variable naming in xfs_bmbt_set_allf/xfs_bmbt_disk_set_allf to have some
    meaning instead of one char variable names.

    issues in the tracing / debug printf code that are fixed by this patch.
