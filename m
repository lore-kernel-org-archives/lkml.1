do you have data to support this? The data we have from this patch is 
that it saves typically a Watt of power (depends on the machine of 
course, but the range is 0.5W to 1.5W). If you want to also have an 
even more agressive thing where you want to start disabling the entire 
controller... I don't see how this is in conflict with saving power on 
the link level by "just" enabling a hardware feature ....
