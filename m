Yes sure.

Why do you think so?

Please look at the "patch" below,

We also need a similar change in do_signal(). Now,

	-		ret = -ERESTARTNOHAND;
	+		ret = -ERESTART_XXX;

Perhaps I missed something else, though. Not that I really think it worth
changing, but I'll try to make a proof of concept patch on Weekend, on top
of Roland's cleanups.

As I see it, the main disadvantage of ERESTART_ approach is that we need 2
new ERESTART_ codes, one for ERESTARTNOHAND, another for ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK.
And yes, while I personally think this is "more clean", it is very subjective.

Oleg.
