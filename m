I meant something simple like:

	__REQ_RW = BIO_RW,
	__REQ_FAILFAST_DEV = BIO_RW_FAILFAST_DEV,
	__REQ_FAILFAST_TRANSPORT = BIO_RW_FAILFAST_TRANSPORT,
	__REQ_FAILFAST_DRIVER = BIO_RW_FAILFAST_DRIVER,
	...

And a fat comment which you did

It's becoming futile to comments on patches these days they get submitted
before and during any comments. ;-)

I think that everywhere we should use __set_bit() __clear_bit() and
test_bit() with enums defined as bit-positions. It is most clear readable
code wise, least error prone, and easiest to maintain.
Perhaps a new:
	test_bits(void *flag, unsigned bit1, ...);
for testing bunch of bits at once

Please note that with inlines and constant bits the generated code is
just as fast as bit-mask. Without slaving over double definitions.
(and accessors)
