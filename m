Hi Jeff,

I did some more NFS readahead tests. Judging from your and mine tests, I can
say that the context readahead is safe for trivial NFS workloads :-) It is
behaving in the expected way, and the overheads, if any, are close enough
to the fluctuating margin.

The default options observed in my test platforms:
        - client: CFQ, kernel 2.6.30-rc3 + linux-2.6-block.git for linus
        - server: CFQ, kernel 2.6.30-rc2-next-20090417
is
        - rsize=256k
        - NFS readahead size=3840k (= 256k * 15)
        - sda readahead size=128k

I tried to measure the overheads, here is the approach:
- random read(4K) syscalls on a huge sparse file over NFS
- server side readahead size=1M, otherwise all default options

The -0.1%, +0.5% differences in time are close enough to the variance.

                  vanilla    +max_sane_readahead()      +mmap readahead
        run-1     77.01s      77.18                     77.96s
        run-2     77.18s      77.53                     77.76s
        run-3     77.93s      77.57                     77.84s
        run-4     77.76s                                78.16s
        run-5     77.55s                                77.76s
        run-6                                           77.90s

        diff%                 -0.1%                     +0.5%

Good news. I'm running with it :-)

Then I go on to test sequential reads on real files over NFS.

Again the differences are small enough.

        vanilla        +mmap&context readahead   diff%
nfsd=1  28.875s        28.770s                   -0.4%
nfsd=8  42.533s        42.255s                   -0.7%

For the single nfsd case, the readahead sequence is perfect and exactly the
same before/after the context readahead patch:
