Hi,

As you say, JFS_CP_ABORT isn't necessarily needed in the most cases,
but it is needed for __journal_abort_checkpoint() which report the
checkpoint related error by printk only once.  If we use JFS_ABORT
to check whether this call is second time, the error message may be
never printed out because the journal has been aborted by another
reason.  If we don't check for the second call, the error message
will be printed out several times.

Instead of using __journal_abort_checkpoint(), we'll be able to do
the similar thing by adding the printk() directly in journal_destroy(),
journal_flush(), and __log_wait_for_space() (but it can be more
than one time).

I agree that we should not add another flag as much as possible.
So I'll try to revise to remove the flag if you agree to add
3 printk()s.

OK, I'll do so.

Your idea looks good.  But as Josef pointed out, journal_destroy()
frees sbi->s_journal, so we need to make journal_destroy() return the
error status.

log_do_checkpoint() calls cleanup_journal_tail(), which advances
j_tail and j_tail_sequence.  So if we adopt the policy that we don't
modify j_tail and j_tail_sequence when checkpointing failed, we should
also fix cleanup_journal_tail().

I adopted the policy that we don't update the journal super block
when checkpointing failed.  When checkpointing failed, journal_abort()
is called before cleanup_journal_tail().  So what we want to write
should be in the journal super block.

Certainly, fsck or journal_recover() replay the unwritten-back metadata
block.  journal_destroy() also call log_do_checkpoint() against all
un-checkpointed transactions.  I just thought `flush' means writing out
all data which we should write to disk.  There is no problem if I
don't change the loop.
