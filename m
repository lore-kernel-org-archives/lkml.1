It's very unlikely to add new restrictions.

I don't think that your argument, 'the problem that we don't know', is
true.

With the vmerge accounting, we calculate at two places. So if we add
a new restriction, we need to handle it at two places. It's a logical
result.

Of course, it's easier to calculate at one place rather than two
places. But 'we don't know what restriction we will need' isn't a
problem.


BTW, as I've already said, I'm not against removing the vmerge
accounting from the block layer.
