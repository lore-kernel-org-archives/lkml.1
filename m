This isn't really a correct assessment.  Wide ports are a SAS only
problem.  So sas has phys and ports ... and it's the port (essentially a
virtual object) that communicates in the link diagram.

A wide port has two or more phys in it.  You can see the handling of
this in libsas and the sas transport class today, but it's all handled
in a fashion completely invisible to the SCSI mid layer ... it's an
inessential abstraction, if you will.
