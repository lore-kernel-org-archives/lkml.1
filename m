Note that this is an XFS special.  Every other filesystem (at least the
major ones) rely on the VFS to write out data.

This is a common problem that would hit any filesystem trying to have
some sort of ordered data or journaled data mode.

I would guess more are broken now then a change in order would break.
Then again purely a change in order would still leave this code
fragile as hell.

Locking can't be the reason as we should never hold locks while
returning from one of the VFS operations.  I think it's performance
or rather alledged performance as I think it doesn't really matter.
If it matters however there is an easy method to make it perform just
as well with a proper callout - just spawn a thread for every filesystem
to perform it in parallel.

I think having a method for this would be useful.  And given that
a proper sync should be exactly the same as a filesysytem freeze
we should maybe use one method for both of those and use the chance
to give filesystem better control over the freeze process?
