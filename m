only if state_in_sysfs is set.

This is only set if the caller previously failed to call kobject_del
(i.e. device_del).

As long as devices follow the proper create->add->del->put paths, the
final put may be called from interrupt context.

Your analysis is wrong because you're basing it on the exception cleanup
paths not the correct calling paths.
