Because it's an exported interface, we can't just move things around at
will.

I don't know why you keep saying currently. It has always had a queue,
and I don't see a good reason why that should change for "special" block
devices like md/dm/loop/whatnot.

It is indeed a bit of a toss-up there, since we do a queue associated
with each gendisk.

No we cannot, not without a time machine. 2.6.30 is released, so it's
too late to revert things like that, even if we wanted.
