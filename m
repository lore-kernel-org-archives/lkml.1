Right that was what i was referring to.

Good point.  And in that case what do we care about (even though
apparently we just might not care at all :) - who did the mount,
or who is using it?

In fact one thing I noticed in Matt's patch 3 was that he copied
in the nodename verbatim, so a future hostname() by the container
wouldn't be reflected, again not sure if that would matter.

Right, but I *was* thinking that we wanted to associate the nodename
on the rpc calls with the hostname of the mounter, not the actor.  Maybe
you'll tell me above that that is bogus.

So should we use patch 2/4, plus (as someone - was it you? - suggested)
using a DEFAULT instead of init_utsname()->nodename when
current->utsname() == NULL?
