What's the server side kernel version, plus client/server side
readahead size? I'd expect the context readahead to handle it well.

With the patchset in <http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/2/23/376>, you can
actually see the readahead details:

        # echo 1 > /debug/tracing/events/readahead/enable
        # cp test-file /dev/null
        # cat /debug/tracing/trace  # trimmed output
        readahead-initial(dev=0:15, ino=100177, req=0+2, ra=0+4-2, async=0) = 4
        readahead-subsequent(dev=0:15, ino=100177, req=2+2, ra=4+8-8, async=1) = 8
        readahead-subsequent(dev=0:15, ino=100177, req=4+2, ra=12+16-16, async=1) = 16
        readahead-subsequent(dev=0:15, ino=100177, req=12+2, ra=28+32-32, async=1) = 32
        readahead-subsequent(dev=0:15, ino=100177, req=28+2, ra=60+60-60, async=1) = 24
        readahead-subsequent(dev=0:15, ino=100177, req=60+2, ra=120+60-60, async=1) = 0

And I've actually verified the NFS case with the help of such traces
long ago.  When client_readahead_size <= server_readahead_size, the
readahead requests may look a bit random at first, and then will
quickly turn into a perfect series of sequential context readaheads.

Thanks,
