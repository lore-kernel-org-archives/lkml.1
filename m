Btw, please stop spreading FUD about ConfigFS.  ConfigFS works great for
Target_Core_Mod and LIO-Target v3.0, and is what I have found as the
*BEST* foundation for generic target mod moving forward.  This is not
based on a hypothetical discussion or on a long term TODO list, this has
been determined from actually writing the code, which is located at:

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/nab/lio-core-2.6.git;a=blob;f=drivers/lio-core/target_core_configfs.c

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/nab/lio-core-2.6.git;a=blob;f=drivers/lio-core/iscsi_target_configfs.c

So please, just because you don't want to acknowledge ConfigFS in your
own work, do not act like there is not already thounsands of lines of
ConfigFS code up and running for the generic target mode and LIO-Target.
