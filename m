Yes I mean C/R of sshd with active connections.

Indeed, containers allow to implement VPS just like virtual machines: we
call them system containers. Not much to say about that since they don't
introduce new concepts to users.

Theorically, yes. Practicaly, you need a lot more than *simply* capturing
and restoring socket states for such a migration to be usable in the real
world.

So Alexey should provide some realistic examples, with several hosts,
routers, switches and overall network infrastructure.

I'm _only_ interested in these other scenarios for the moment.

Discussion must go on then. There's no hurry in getting C/R
mainlined. :)
