I must admit I have only read some of the barrier related posts, so this
issue may have been covered.  If so, sorry.

What I have read seems to be related to a single disk.  What if a logical
disk is used (md, LVM, ...)?  If a barrier is issued to a logical disk and
that driver issues barriers to all related devices (logical or physical),
all the devices MUST honor the barrier together.  If 1 device crosses the
barrier before another reaches the barrier, corruption should be assumed.
It seems to me each block device that represents more than 2 other devices
must do a flush at a barrier so that all devices will cross the barrier at
the same time.
