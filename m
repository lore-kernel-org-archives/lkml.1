Awesome.  Thanks for testing!  Our actime is much shorter which is
probably why it happens sooner for us.

Hmm... yep.  I don't know what guarantees we want to make.   The
behavior doesn't seem to be consistent with older kernels though... so
I'm thinking it might be a bug.

We hit this particular issue because we have scripts which essentially
'tail -f' log files looking for errors.   They miss log messages (and
see corrupted ones) b/c of the NULLs.  That's also why there is no
serialization.... we don't need it when grep'ing through log messages.

I'm bisecting now.  I see a block of intricate-looking NFS patches, I'll
try to narrow it down to a particular commit. =20

I'll also get the wireshark data at that point.

					Thanks,
