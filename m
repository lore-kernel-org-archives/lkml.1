Hi Ryo,

I am running a sequential reader in one group and few random reader and
writers in second group. Both groups are of same weight. I ran fio scripts
for 60 seconds and then looked at the output. In this case looks like we just
kill the throughput of sequential reader and disk (because random
readers/writers take over).

I ran the test "with-dm-ioband", "without-dm-ioband" and "with ioscheduler
based io controller".

First I am pasting the results and in the end I will paste my test
scripts. I have cut fio output heavily so that we does not get lost in
lots of output.

with-dm-ioband
==============

ioband1
-------
randread: (groupid=0, jobs=4): err= 0: pid=3610
  read : io=18,432KiB, bw=314KiB/s, iops=76, runt= 60076msec
    clat (usec): min=140, max=744K, avg=50866.75, stdev=61266.88

randwrite: (groupid=1, jobs=2): err= 0: pid=3614
  write: io=920KiB, bw=15KiB/s, iops=3, runt= 60098msec
    clat (usec): min=203, max=14,171K, avg=522937.86, stdev=960929.44

ioband2
-------
seqread0: (groupid=0, jobs=1): err= 0: pid=3609
  read : io=37,904KiB, bw=636KiB/s, iops=155, runt= 61026msec
    clat (usec): min=92, max=9,969K, avg=6437.89, stdev=168573.23

without dm-ioband (vanilla cfq, no grouping)
============================================
seqread0: (groupid=0, jobs=1): err= 0: pid=3969
  read : io=321MiB, bw=5,598KiB/s, iops=1,366, runt= 60104msec
    clat (usec): min=91, max=763K, avg=729.61, stdev=17402.63

randread: (groupid=0, jobs=4): err= 0: pid=3970
  read : io=15,112KiB, bw=257KiB/s, iops=62, runt= 60039msec
    clat (usec): min=124, max=1,066K, avg=63721.26, stdev=78215.17

randwrite: (groupid=1, jobs=2): err= 0: pid=3974
  write: io=680KiB, bw=11KiB/s, iops=2, runt= 60073msec
    clat (usec): min=199, max=24,646K, avg=706719.51, stdev=1774887.55

With ioscheduer based io controller patches
===========================================
cgroup 1 (weight 100)
---------------------
randread: (groupid=0, jobs=4): err= 0: pid=2995
  read : io=9,484KiB, bw=161KiB/s, iops=39, runt= 60107msec
    clat (msec): min=1, max=2,167, avg=95.47, stdev=131.60

randwrite: (groupid=1, jobs=2): err= 0: pid=2999
  write: io=2,692KiB, bw=45KiB/s, iops=11, runt= 60131msec
    clat (usec): min=199, max=30,043K, avg=178710.05, stdev=1281485.75

cgroup 2 (weight 100)
--------------------
seqread0: (groupid=0, jobs=1): err= 0: pid=2993
  read : io=547mib, bw=9,556kib/s, iops=2,333, runt= 60043msec
    clat (usec): min=92, max=224k, avg=426.74, stdev=5734.12

Note the BW of sequential reader in three cases
(636 KB/s, 5,598KiB/s, 9,556KiB/s). dm-ioband tries to provide fairness in
terms of number of sectors and it completely kills the disk throughput.

with io scheduler based io controller, we see increased throughput for
seqential reader as compared to CFQ, because now random readers are
running in a separate group and hence reader gets isolation from random
readers.

Here are my fio jobs
--------------------
First fio job file
-----------------
[global]
runtime=60

[randread]
rw=randread
size=2G
iodepth=20
directory=/mnt/sdd1/fio/
direct=1
numjobs=4
group_reporting

[randwrite]
rw=randwrite
size=1G
iodepth=20
directory=/mnt/sdd1/fio/
group_reporting
direct=1
numjobs=2

Second fio job file
-------------------
[global]
runtime=60
rw=read
size=4G
directory=/mnt/sdd2/fio/
direct=1

[seqread0]
numjobs=1
group_reporting

Thanks
