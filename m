I think it's more like how many bytes are valid where the validity is
defined as the number of meaningful bytes on dev -> host commands and
the number of bytes the device actually consumed on the other
direction.  Please note that this is different from the number of
bytes transferred due to padding or under other error conditions.

Yeap, I was wondering about the combination 0 resid count + failure.
What would it mean?  All bytes are valid but the command failed?

The behavior wasn't guaranteed before the change in paths including
SG_IO fast fail one.  libata and ide have been and are completely
funky about residual counts anyway so I highly doubt anyone has been
depending on it.

There's nothing wrong with keeping the original behavior in itself but
to me it looks like it would be a bad precedence when no one should
depend on the behavior.

Thanks.
