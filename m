Okay, I (finally) looked into this.  The meaning of blocked counts is
that to wait (count - 1) * plug delay if the target (be it device or
host) is idle before retrying.  libata uses deferring to implement
command scheduling and as such, there shouldn't be any delay if the
target is not busy.

Elias's synthetic test case triggered infinite loop because it wasn't
a proper ->qc_defer().  ->qc_defer() should never defer commands when
the target is idle.

Attached is debug patch to monitor libata command deferring.  It will
whine if certain command is retried 10 times or more, or ->qc_defer()
is called in rapid succession.  I couldn't find anything wrong with
it.  When IDENTIFY is queued while NCQ commands are in flight, it
waited for several hundreds millisecs for NCQ commands to drain with
each ->qc_defer() calling spaced by several milliseconds as determined
by in-flight NCQ command completion.

So, blocked counts of 1 are just fine as long as ->qc_defer() doesn't
try to defer a command when the target is idle.  That said, there's no
harm in increasing the blocked count to two or even leaving it at the
default because those blocked counters are reset to 0 whenever a
command completes and by the same logic which makes blocked counts of
1 okay, it's guaranteed that every deferred command will have matching
command completions to clear its blocked counts.

As the current code has been working well for quite some time now, I'm
more inclined to leave it as it is.

Thanks.
