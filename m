IO controller can know how many requests are issued and still in
progress. Is it not enough to accumulate the time while in-flight IOs
exist?

It could be solved by implementing the way to pass on such information
from IO scheduler to higher layer controller.

I think that disk time is not simply proportional to IO size. If there
are two groups whose wights are equally assigned and they issue
different sized IOs repsectively, the bandwidth of each group would
not distributed equally as expected.

bio is grabbed in generic_make_request() and throttled as well as
dm-ioband's mechanism. dmsetup command is not necessary any longer.

I'm not sure why the developers of the device driver choose their own
way, and the driver is provided in binary form, so we can't modify it.

The default value of io_limit on the previous test was 128 (not 192)
which is equall to the default value of nr_request.

O.K. You removed "conv=fdatasync", the new dm-ioband handles
sync/async requests separately, and it solves this
buffered-write-starves-read problem. I would like to post it soon
after doing some more test.

When the number of in-flight IOs exceeds io_limit, processes which are
going to issue IOs are made sleep by dm-ioband until all the in-flight
IOs are finished. But IO scheduler layer can accept IO requests more
than the value of io_limit, so it was a bottleneck of the throughput.

O.K. I'll try to do more test with dm-ioband according to your
comments especially working with CFQ. Thanks for pointing out.
