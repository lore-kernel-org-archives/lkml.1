Yeah, I think that there are good reasons why we shouldn't inline the
sense buffer. As I already wrote, seems that the DMA requirement
wasn't properly understood; it's not about the alignment.

Can we just fix some drivers not to do the DMA with the sense buffer in
scsi_cmnd? IIRC, there are only five or six drivers that do such.
