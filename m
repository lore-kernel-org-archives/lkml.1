This is disgusting.

Why don't you just create the namespace once?

Also, why do you need that disgusting pivot thing, when we could instead 
trivially just add a 

	struct filesystem *fs;

into the nameidata, and then we can initialize it to

	nd->fs = current->fs

and make all the path walkers use that.

Or we could even try to clean up that horrid AT_FDCWD mess, and drop the 
whole "dfd" passing to "do_path_lookup()", and instead do

	rwlock_t *lock;
	struct path *root, *pwd;

and do

	nd->lock = &current->fs->lock;
	nd->root = &current->fs->root;
	nd->pwd =  &current->fs->pwd;

to initialize things. Then drop dfd as an argument entirely from 
path_lookup_open() and do_path_lookup(), and just have the caller 
initialize the nameidata (the only caller that doesn't use fs->pwd 
currently is do_filp_open(), which takes that 'dfd' and could just 
initialize nd->pwd to the right thing.

I dunno. This is very Al Viroish country, but I really hate how your patch 
looks. 99% of it is just working around the fact that you want some very 
_slight_ differences to how that special '/' thing is handled.

It's not worth doing these kinds of hacks for that.

And I think it's positively _wrong_ to have a function that creates and 
destroys the whole "struct fs_struct" and a namespace for just one call. 
Even if you don't think it's at all performance-critical, the interface is 
too damn ugly. Have separate "create/destroy context" functions, so that 
you _can_ do it just once, and have multiple calls in between.

Even if you personally don't happen to care.
