I can try it but I have very little faith in that result to be honest.

Well I've been doing bisects but I'm getting skeptical of the results; 
either my testcase isn't reliable enough or all the merges are confusing 
git-bisect (?)  Anyway it keeps ending up on nonsensical commits.

After talking to Aneesh last night, I think other good spot-checks will 
be to revert 487caeef9fc08c0565e082c40a8aaf58dad92bbb, and to test Jan's 
sync patches.
