Fix section mismatch in the Adaptec DPT SCSI Raid driver.

WARNING: vmlinux.o(.init.text+0x1fcd2): Section mismatch:
	reference to .exit.text:adpt_exit (between 'adpt_init' and 'ahc_linux_init')

This warning is due to adaptec device detection calling the exit routine
on failure to properly register the adaptec device.

The exit routine + call was added on July 30 by

  Author: Matthew Wilcox
  Subject: [SCSI] dpt_i2o: convert to SCSI hotplug model.

Mathew: isn't a module exit routine a little too strong to be calling
on the failure of a single device?  Module exit implies that other,
non-failing adaptec raid devices will also get shut down.
