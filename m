I more or less see, thanks. But (1) pages still needs to be mmaped to 
the user space process before the data transmission, i.e. they must be 
zeroed before being mmaped, which isn't much faster, than data copy, and 
(2) I suspect, it would be hard to make it race free, e.g. if another 
process would want to write to the same area simultaneously

The performance improvement from zero copy can be easily estimated, 
knowing the link throughput and data copy throughput, which are about 
the same for 20Gbps links (I did that few e-mail ago).
