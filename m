Even with 32MB cache, 30secs should be more than enough.  It's not
like the drive is gonna do random write on those.  It's likely to make
only very few number of strokes over the platter and it really
shouldn't take very long.  I'm yet to see an actual case where a
properly functioning drive timed out flush because the flush itself
took long enough.

Yes, this is a possibility and according to the spec, libata EH should
be retrying flushes a few times before giving up but I'm not sure
whether keeping retrying for several minutes is a good idea either.
Is it?

Thanks.
