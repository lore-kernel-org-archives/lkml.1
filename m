Thanks for the testing!  So this was with the following three patches
applied on the server on top of 2.6.26?

	[PATCH 1/3] SUNRPC: Ensure the server closes sockets in a timely fashion
	[PATCH 2/3] SUNRPC: We only need to call svc_delete_xprt() once...
	[PATCH 3/3] SUNRPC: svc_xprt_enqueue should not refuse to enqueue 'XPT_DEAD' transports

I'll try to take a look at these before I leave for the holidays,
assuming the versions Trond posted on Nov. 30 are the latest.
