OK, actually, this is wierd for me now.  Is this warning ONLY generated
on modules?

I build with no modules, but do have modules enabled due to nVidia.  I
did post about a module called 'scsi_wait' being built, even though I
didn't want it/need it but can't stop it - please refer:

http://marc.info/?t=119705493500007&r=1&w=2

If this is true, what I have now is a module being built I don't
want/need and can't stop it being built, and a warning about it not
using bus_type methods anyway.
