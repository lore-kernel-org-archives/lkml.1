Well, going by that theory every SCSI driver can share some code with
any other SCSI driver, In short we can come up with an low level SCSI
driver interface which every SCSI driver can make use of, to reduce
code duplicity.  We don't do that, and the reason being, that its a
device and we shouldn't expect every device to share common features
or design decisions.

We already virtualize storage at the lowest (read device) level to
avoid duplicating stuff in a guest operating system.
If this was say a block level virtaulizing scheme sharing would be
more eminent, but given that we are a device its better to keep things
separate and IMHO, it might be an overkill to design a new pv-driver
or some such layer for every device that you virtualize.

Thanks,
Alok
