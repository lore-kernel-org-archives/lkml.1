Yes. Tasks from different nodes have parent-children, session leader, etc.
relationships, and the distributed management of struct pid lifecycle is a =
bit
touchy too. By the way, splitting the checkpoint image in one file for each=
 task
helps us a lot to make restart parallel, because it is more efficient for t=
he file
system to handle parallel reads of different files from different nodes than
parallel reads on a single file descriptor from different nodes.

See my answer to Dave.

Yes, I hope that investigating both approaches will give us stronger argume=
nts.
