Great. :-)

Having enumed tag types limits that a sb can have map to only one tag
but it doesn't really prevent multiple possibly visible entries which is
the real unnecessary degrees of freedom.  That said, I don't really
think it's an issue.

I still would prefer something which is more generic.  The abstraction
is clearer too.  A sb shows untagged and a set of tags.  A sd can either
be untagged or tagged (a single tag).

Using ida (or idr if a pointer for private data is necessary) is really
easy.  It'll probably take a few tens of lines of code.  That said, I
don't think I have enough rationale to nack what you described.  So, as
long as the tags are made static, I won't object.

Thanks.
