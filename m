Dear Russell.
You are right. I apologize. I was too trigger happy.
I should have resend the request. The patches were in scsi-pending and
in -mm. And I assumed it was all good. But it was not accepted into
scsi-misc and was somewhat forgotten.

I assure you, my email management skills are just as laking as yours. 
Just that my responsibility's are few.
