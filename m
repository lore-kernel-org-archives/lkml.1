While most common filesystem do have barrier support it is:

 - not actually enabled for the two most common filesystems
 - the support for write barriers an cache flushing tends to be buggy
   all over our software stack,

All currently working barrier implementations on Linux are built upon
queue drains and cache flushes, plus sometimes setting the FUA bit.
