This patch hasn't been tested at all, I'm sorry if I gave you that
impression, it isn't in Gentoo's patches, it's just been brought to our
attention in the bug I linked too.

I created another patch, based on your recommendations, and with a lot of
help from Daniel Drake (dsd@gentoo.org), that's included below. Some
changes are made to test_unit_ready() to be able to pass the sense data
to sr_drive_status(). Currently, sr_do_ioctl() swallows this data and
makes its own interpretations of sense codes, which isn't what we want
here.

Is this what you had in mind? Do you think the possible problems with
USB drives that you mentioned will prevent this patch from going in? 
The patch has only been compile tested right now, we can do some real
testing later, for now I'd just like to get your feedback on it.

Maarten
