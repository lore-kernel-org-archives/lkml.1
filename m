Tried it, not for sure if I like the results yet or not...  Didn't seem
to make a huge difference, but here is something that will really make
you want to drink, the 2.6.25.4 kernel does not go into the size-4096
hell.  The largest users of slab there are the size-1024 and still the
skbuff_fclone_cache.  On a box with 16 threads, it will cache up about 5
GB of disk data, and still use about 6 GB of slab to put the information
out there (without TSO on), but at least it is not causing the disk
cache to be evicted, and it appears to be a little more responsive.  If
I up it to 32 or more threads, however, it gets very sluggish, but then
again, I am hitting it with a lot of nodes.

We currently are hitting with somewhere around 600 to 800 nodes, but it
can go up to over 1000 nodes.  We are artificially starving with a
limited number of threads (2 to 3) right now on the older 2.6.22.14
kernel because of that memory issue (which may or may not be tso
related)...

I really want to move forward to the newer kernel, but we had an issue
where clients all of the sudden wouldn't connect, yet other clients
could, to the exact same server NFS export.  I had booted the server
into the 2.6.25.4 kernel at the time, and the other admin set us back to
the 2.6.22.14 to see if that was it.  The clients started working again,
and he left it there (he also took out my options in the exports file,
no_subtree_check and insecure).  I know that we are running over the
number of privelaged ports, and we probably need the insecure, but I am
having a hard time wrapping my self around all of the problems at
once....
