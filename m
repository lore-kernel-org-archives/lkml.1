Actually, no we don't.  SCSI level 0 means "no compliant standard
specified".  We're quite careful if we see this not to do anything that
might upset the device ... SCSI level 0 is a fairly usual thing to see
on USB devices, which is why we process it differently.

Like I said, it should all be fixed ... if you try it.
