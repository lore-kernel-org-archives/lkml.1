I did explain a little bit yesterday here:

	http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/2/9/508

The upshot is that on ia64, in the cpu_down() path, in practice,
we're only seeing the timer interrupt fire, even on a heavily
loaded system with lots of I/O.

And in our timer interrupt routine, we're checking to make sure
that the CPU is online before handling the interrupt.

So at least empirically, we don't seem to allow any offline CPUs
to handle interrupts.

I played around with cpu_active_map yesterday, and realized the
patch I posted was incomplete. When I started fleshing it out a
bit more, I learned that we're simply not using cpu_active_map in
the kernel to the extent that we're using cpu_online_map, and I'm
a bit hesitant to start introducing regressions because I missed
a usage somewhere.

With this below patch, I can't even offline a single CPU, and the
patch is already twice as big as the revert. At this point, the
revert has held up to testing, and in my view, is the clear short
term winner.

I can keep exploring the cpu_active_mask option, but that would
be a .30 activity, and I'd like to get this particular oops fixed
for .29.

Seem like a reasonable way forward?

Thanks.
