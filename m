#2 is the difficult one.  If you wait for memory pressure, you could
have waited too long, because depending on the latency of the commit,
you could run into low-memory situations.  Then mayhem ensues, the
oom-killer gets cranky (if you haven't disabled it), and stuff starts
failing and/or hanging.  So you need to be careful about setting the
threshold for generating a commit so that the client doesn't run out of
memory before the server can respond.
