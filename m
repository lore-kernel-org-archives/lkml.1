I can't tell whether you understood my point.  After a scsi_device is
unregistered but before it is released -- i.e., when its state is
SDEV_DEL -- it _is_ essentially unusable.  So why wait until it is
released to decrement the target's device counter?  Why not do the
decrement in __scsi_remove_device()?

Yes, granted.  That integration doesn't have to be complicated.  
Basically, you just decrement the counters in all the targets when
setting a host's state to SHOST_DEL or SHOST_DEL_RECOVERY.  At that 
point there's no reason to keep an unpopulated target around, right?

Up until that point, the counter's value should be one more than the
number of underlying sdevs.  So if the counter decrements to 0 then
there were no underlying sdevs and the target is deleted immediately;
otherwise it is deleted when the last remaining sdev is deleted.
