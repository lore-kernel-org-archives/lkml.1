We thought of that years ago.  Unfortunately there is no reliable way
of telling when a capacity value is wrong.  There definitely do exist
disks with an odd number of sectors.

Furthermore, doing I/O to a suspect block is not a good idea.  There
are plenty of devices which simply crash when you try to access a
nonexistent sector.

I imagine they do.  However Linux has partition code that stores
information in the last sector of a partition (EFI GUID and md, for
example).  Other OS's apparently do not try to access the medium's last
sector under most circumstances.

usb-storage isn't in the business of altering the data it gets from a 
device.  It's just a transport.  That's why the sdev->fix_capacity flag 
exists; we tell the upper layer that the data it gets is going to be 
wrong and let the upper layer worry about fixing things up.

No, partition scanning.  Also maybe /lib/udev/vol_id, which seems to 
read an inordinate number of irrelevant sectors.
