I think that's taught us that '0' and '1' are insufficiently
descriptive, and we should either be passing in a state (ie
do_nanosleep(x, y, TASK_FOO), or have separate do_nanosleep_killable()
and do_nanosleep_interruptible()).

We should be trying to accommodate the user's wishes wherever possible.
If they say kill -9, they really mean it, and we should stop waiting.
Now, I don't think we should abort the journal_stop().  That's probably
going too far in this instance.  But we should stop waiting for other
tasks to join in, and finish up as quickly as possible.
