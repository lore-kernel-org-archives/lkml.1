modprobe scsi_debug dix=199 dif=1 guard=1 dev_size_mb=1024 num_parts=1

I'm testing with XFS and btrfs.  Generally doing kernel builds, etc.
ext2/3 are still problematic because they modify pages in flight.


Jeff> I set out to try your changes, but ran into some problems.
Jeff> First, this patch set didn't apply cleanly to a git checkout.

I generally track Linus closely so it must be because of the patches
you were missing.  

You can grab my patch stack here.  It's always in sync with the hg
repo:

Odd.  Which compiler are you using?  Compiles just fine for me on both
EL5 and FC9.

Judging from the error I'm guessing it's objecting to the inlining.
Tried to work around it.  Please pull, update and let me know whether
that did the trick.
