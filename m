I don't intend that Smack be thought of as a complete security model.
Smack implements Mandatory Access Control, but leaves the privilege
mechanism (root and/or capabilities) to the whims of others. Similarly
Smack does not do DAC (unlike SELinux with MCS) although "owned rules"
has been proposed as an additional feature. I certainly wouldn't
want every new facility that comes in to require multiple versions
that depend on the other LSMs involved. It's true that today's LSM is
optimized for the only LSM that existed a year ago, and that was a
monolythic security model.

I share this view, which add credibility to the claim that it's
not popular. (smiley)

It does seem as if a separate Linux Privilege Module framework
might be a better scheme. It would be very easy to pull out, and
simple to create the obvious LPMs:

- Traditional root
  hooks look like "return (euid == 0) ? 0 : -EACCES;"
- No access check at all
  hooks look like "return 0;"
- Root or capabilities
  hooks look like "return (euid == 0 || capable(xxx)) ? 0 : -EACCES;"
- Pure capabilities
  hooks look like "return capable(xxx) ? 0 : -EACCES;"

Plus, if SELinux wants to abandon capabilities they can add thier own
scheme or insist the user use the noop LPM and do whatever they like
in the LSM. Smack has no intention of mucking with the privilege
mechanism, and will happily go along with whatever the rest of the
system wants to use, although the noop LSM seems a bit pointless in
that case.

I don't remember that, but it's been a long time so it could be true.

This is why Smack is sticking to MAC rather than trying to be a
wholistic security policy mechanism. To quote the prophet, "God
created the world in 7 days, but then, He didn't have an install
base".

In particular, capabilities are not an access control mechanism,
they are a privilege mechanism. A lot of discussion about LSM has
centered around the appropriate charactoristics of an LSM, and
these discussions always assume that the LSM in question is
exactly an access control mechanism. If we split the LSM into
a LACM for access control and an LPM for privilege management
maybe we can eliminate the most contentious issues.
 
Does anyone know why that would be stoopid before I whack out
patches?

Thank you.
