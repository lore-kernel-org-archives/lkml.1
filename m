It isn't essential dm-band is implemented as one of the device-mappers.
I've been also considering that this algorithm itself can be implemented
in the block layer directly.

Although, the current implementation has merits. It is flexible.
  - Dm-ioband can be place anywhere you like, which may be right before
    the I/O schedulers or may be placed on top of LVM devices.
  - It supports partition based bandwidth control which can work without
    cgroups, which is quite easy to use of.
  - It is independent to any I/O schedulers including ones which will
    be introduced in the future.

I also understand it's will be hard to set up without some tools
such as lvm commands.

I think it's a bit late to control I/O requests there, since process
may be blocked in get_request_wait when the I/O load is high.
Please imagine the situation that cgroups with low bandwidths are
consuming most of "struct request"s while another cgroup with a high
bandwidth is blocked and can't get enough "struct request"s.

It means cgroups that issues lot of I/O request can win the game.
