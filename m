Thanks! I hope to get time for this tonight and will get back to you;
I appreciate your help, Jeff.

The config I used to reproduce it on the client is
http://www.quora.org/config-debug and is relevant to (at least)
2.6.26-rc5. I was able to reproduce it by exporting a single NFSv4
export on 2.6.25 (eg Ubuntu 8.04 server); client and server were
x86-64.

Daniel
