?  If I've just quoted the patch above why would I not remember it now.
I've just said it's the cause of the problems in the -rt tree.

Actually, you were cc'd, you probably just missed it.

Look, I've no problem with you collecting random patches.  I have a
problem when you start pushing random SCSI patches into other trees.  I
think this thread clearly illustrates why it's a problem.

Even if *I* sent you a patch asking if it fixes your bug, it doesn't
mean you should be deploying it on production systems ... we have
process, like code inspection and integration testing to got through
before patches appear in the SCSI trees.

For the particular patch in question (the corrected form).  I don't
actually believe it's a bug fix.  I've gone over it and best I can tell,
it does what it says it does (merely reposition the code) ... there's no
actual logic alterations at all.  So I think, unfortunately, whatever
the bug is, it's timing related (the patch does shorten some code
paths).  Now, sure, we can cover it up and pretend it's gone, but it's
bound to show up again down the road, so I'd like to find it's root
cause now rather than later.
