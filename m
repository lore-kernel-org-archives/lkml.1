Heaven knows.

OK, "This is the first commit after v2.6.26-rc3", so NFS is innocent. 
Presumably your git bisect landed on a big merge commit.

I'm afaid I'm not the person who can tell you how to fix this - it
hasn't happened to me in a while, but I don't know what I did to
prevent it happening :(

Here's the diffstat from your diffs.txt.gz:

Now, distcc has a long track record of tripping up bugs and regressions
in the networking code - it's very clever that way.  But it doesn't
look like there were any relevant networking changes in that window.

So I think the next step is to ask you to continue with (or redo) that
bisection search.

Is there someone who is more git-competent than I who could help with
this please?
