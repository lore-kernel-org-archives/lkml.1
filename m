Hello James,

	I re-submitted the patch yesterday with the "space" issue fixed
(adhering to coding guideline).

	I will check for alternative to calculate the time driver have
been sending host busy to OS. Will check with time_before() as you have
suggested.

	Throttling from megasas_generic_reset() handler did not help.
megaraid does not have feature to abort cmds. So, in the generic reset
routine, the driver just waits for cmd completion by FW. These timed-out
cmds gets retried by mid-layer with "retries" incremented by 1.
Eventually we see retries equals max_allowed followed by SCSI error with
"DRIVER_TIMEOUT".
	
	By throttling from the megasas_queue_command we do not hit the
issue. In our test with this code, retries did not exceed 2. 
	
Regards,

Sumant

please don't do this.  You want to be using time_before() and
jiffies_to_msecs().  The space problems apply to the rest of the code

I really don't think this is a good indicator of your firmware
necessarily having problems; I really think you might want to look at
other indicators ... jiffies_at_alloc might be better, or even
throttling from the abort handler, which must have been called before
you get to here if the command is actually timing out.

Timeout and abort has it's own throttle anyway, since we quiesce the
host before beginning error recovery ... are you sure this scheme
actually solves anything for your device?

James
