It's only too big if you always keep it in memory, and I wasn't
suggesting that.

My point was that you can get completely accurate stack traces in the
face of gcc's inlining, and that blaming gcc because you can't get good
stack traces because the kernel's debugging infrastructure isn't up to
snuff isn't exactly fair.

The bulk of the libraries that your userspace app links to are
distro-built with full optimization and figuring out why an optimized
build crashed does come up from time to time, so those changes still
matter.

And this is where we disagree. I believe that crash dumps should be the
norm and all the reasons you have against crash dumps in general are in
fact reasons against Linux's sub-par implementation of crash dumps in
specific.

I can semi-reliably panic my kernel, and it's fairly recent, too
(2.6.27.9-159.fc10.x86_64). Naturally, I run X, so the result of a panic
is a frozen screen, blinking keyboard lights, the occasional endless
audio loop, and no useful information whatsoever. I looked into kdump,
only to discover that it doesn't work (but it could, it's a simple
matter of fixing the initrd's script to support LVM), but I've already
found a workaround, and after fiddling with kdump, I just don't care
anymore

So, here I am, a non-enterprise end user with a non-stale kernel who'd
love to be able to give you a crash dump (or, more likely, a stack trace
created from that crash dump), but I can't because Linux crash dumps are
stuck in the enterprise ghetto.

You're right, the bulk of the people who do use kdump these days are
enterprise people running ancient enterprise kernels, but that has more
to do with kdump being an unusable bastard red-headed left-handed
stepchild that you only use if you can't avoid it than it has to do with
the crash dump concept being useless.

Hell, I'd be happy if I could get the the normal panic text written to
disk, but since the hard part is the actual writing to disk, there's no
reason not to do the full crash dump if you can.
