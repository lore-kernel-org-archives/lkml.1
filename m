In fact, I have changed my mind.  Starting the timer after the command
has been sent to the low-level driver would mean that the command might
finish before the timer was started!

So never mind.  I did confirm at least that your patch together with 
Mike's fixed the problem I encountered last week.

I have a couple of small fixes for the block timer routines.  They'll 
get posted separately later on.
