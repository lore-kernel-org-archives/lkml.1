This was casued by the call to ext4_error(); the "scheduling while
atomic" BUG error was fixed in 2.6.29-rc1:

commit 5d1b1b3f492f8696ea18950a454a141381b0f926

    ext4: fix BUG when calling ext4_error with locked block group
    
    The mballoc code likes to call ext4_error while it is holding locked
    block groups.  This can causes a scheduling in atomic context BUG.  We
    can't just unlock the block group and relock it after/if ext4_error
    returns since that might result in race conditions in the case where
    the filesystem is set to continue after finding errors.

It's going to be moderately painful to backport this to 2.6.28 and
2.6.27, but we can look into it.

This was caused by an on-disk filesystme corruption which mballoc
detected, which flagged an EXT4 error, which then triggered the BUG.

More evidence of on-disk filesystem corruption....

Sounds like an inode table got corrupted.

Yeah, we have a patch queued up so we can identified the bad inode
number that caused that, but it points to more inode table corruption.

That's another indication of data corruption in inode 1022.  This
could be hardware induced corruption; or it could be a software
induced error.  There's been one other user with a RAID that had
reported a strange corruption near the beginning of the filesystem, in
the inode table.  How big is your filesystem, exactly?  It could be
something that only shows up with sufficiently large filesystems, or
it could be a hardware problem.

Can you send me the output of dumpe2fs of the filesystem in question?
And something that would be worth doing is to use debugfs like this:

debugfs /dev/XXXX

debugfs: imap <1022>

you'll see something like this:

Inode 1022 is part of block group 0
      located at block 128, offset 0x0d00

Take the block number, and then use it as follows:

dd if=/dev/XXXX of=itable.img bs=4k count=1 skip=128

Where the parameter to "skip=NNN" should be replaced with the block
number reported by debugfs's imap command.
