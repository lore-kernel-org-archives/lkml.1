I'd be suspecting a GUI bug if a restart is necessary.  Perhaps it went to
lunch for so long in the kernel that some time-based thing went bad.

Well that all sucks.

Right.  One possibility here is that bonnie is stuffing new dirty blocks
onto the committing transaction's ordered-data list and JBD commit is
livelocking.  Only we're not supposed to be putting those blocks on that
list.

Another livelock possibility is that bonnie is redirtying pages faster than
commit can write them out, so commit got livelocked:

When I was doing the original port-from-2.2 I found that an application
which does

	for ( ; ; )
		pwrite(fd, "", 1, 0);

would permanently livelock the fs.  I fixed that, but it was six years ago,
and perhaps we later unfixed it.

It would be most interesting to try data=writeback.

That's normal.  But bonnie _is_ blocking here, so it obviously cannot be
dirtying buffers while it's doing that.

hm, fsync.

Aside: why the heck do applications think that their data is so important
that they need to fsync it all the time.  I used to run a kernel on my
laptop which had "return 0;" at the top of fsync() and fdatasync().  Most
pleasurable.

But wedging for 20 minutes is probably excessive punishment.

Bottom line: no idea.  Please see if data=writeback changes things, maybe
try the pwrite() loop.
