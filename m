Consider that the disk writes the data and then the system
crashes. Now you have the old checksum but the new data. The checksum
is out of sync.

Don't you mean that M2 is written _before_ the data? That way you have
the old checksum in M1 and the new in M2. One of them will match
depending on wether the data gets written before a crash or not. That
would be more consistent with your read operation below.

What happens if you have multiple writes to the same sector? (assuming
you ment "before" above)

- user writes to sector
- queue up write for M1 and data1
- M1 writes
- user writes to sector
- queue up writes for M2 and data2
- data1 is thrown away as data2 overwrites it
- M2 writes
- system crashes

Now both M1 and M2 have a different checksum than the old data left on
disk.

Can this happen?
