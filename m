  I'll try to explain the locking here:
1) We are not allowed to call into __invalidate_mapping_pages() with
inode_lock held - that it the bug lockdep is complaining about. Moreover it
leads to rather long waiting times for inode_lock (quite possibly several
seconds).
2) When we release inode_lock, we need to protect from inode going away,
thus we hold reference to it - that guarantees us inode stays in the list.
3) When we continue scanning of the list we must get inode_lock before we
put the inode reference to avoid races. But we cannot do iput() when we
hold inode_lock. Thus we save pointer to inode and do iput() next time we
have released the inode_lock...

  Definitely we can do a more involved fix ;) What Andrew proposes would have
some other benefits as well. But until somebody gets to that, this slight
hack should work fine (Andrew has already merged my patch in -mm so I
guess he agrees ;).
