Hm, this sounds good, but I think it will be racy.

Although separating the very tight tie between sysfs and kobject would
be very good to have.  Pat originally wanted to do that years ago,
but he's now lost to the land of a million sheep...

So I don't object to this goal at all.

Ok, I'll but I really want to see that code :)

I agree.
