OK, that was the wrong choice of words, on my part. I meant for sake of
"nobleness". I calculated as a programmer that these are aligned do I make
the extra effort of stating that in code, or I get lazy because it does
not matter?

Well for BE systems we are already order of magnitude faster by just
using the accessors, so I guess we are already well in the "plus" ;)

This is such a small matter, sorry to bother you about it.
Just that it's a programming style I'm constantly debating with myself,
feel free to ignore it.

The patch looks very good to me as it is.

Thanks
Boaz
