Maybe I shouldn't have said "symlinks in the pseudofs", as that's not
entirely well defined--a complicated namespace may transition between
"pseudofs" and "real" filesystems multiple times.  So it's really a
statement about the client's mount behavior: symlinks found along the
mount path will be interpreted one way, symlinks found elsewhere
another.  Right?

Though put that way it's harder to decide what to store in a symlink,
since you can't necessarily control which paths a given client may
decide to mount.

Some may be surprised to find that /mntsymlink/ and /mnt/symlink/ will
be different after

	mount file:/path/symlink/ /mntsymlink/
	mount file:/path/	  /mnt/

I see your point, though it might also be an argument for continuing to
error out on symlinks.

It could also be argued that if a given symlink is expected to be
interpreted on the server side, then the server should just go ahead and
do that for the client, rather than returning it as a symlink.

Seems worth at least mentioning to the ietf group, as different behavior
across different clients would be confusing.
