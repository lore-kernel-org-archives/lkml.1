Please add a comment over this function which specifies its behaviour. 
Really it should be enough material from which a full manpage can be
written.

If that's all too much, this material should at least be spelled out in the
changelog.  Because there's no way in which this change can be fully
reviewed unless someone (ie: you) tells us what it is setting out to
achieve.

If we 100% implement some standard then a URL for what we claim to
implement would suffice.  Given that we're at least using different types from
posix I doubt if such a thing would be sufficient.

And given the complexity and potential variability within the filesystem
implementations of this, I'd expect that _something_ additional needs to be
said?

The posix spec implies that negative `len' is permitted - presumably "allocate
ahead of `offset'".  How peculiar.

So we return ENODEV against an S_ISBLK fd, as per the posix spec.  That
seems a bit silly of them.

This code does handle offset+len going negative, but only by accident, I
suspect.  It happens that s_maxbytes has unsigned type.  Perhaps a comment
here would settle the reader's mind.

If we _are_ going to support negative `len', as posix suggests, I think we
should perform the appropriate sanity conversions to `offset' and `len'
right here, rather than expecting each filesystem to do it.

If we're not going to handle negative `len' then we should check for it.

I don't believe this needs to be exported to modules?

Now those aren't in posix.  They should be documented, along with their
expected semantics.

I really do think it's better to put the variable names in definitions such
as this.  Especially when we have two identically-typed variables next to
each other like that.  Quick: which one is the offset and which is the
length?
