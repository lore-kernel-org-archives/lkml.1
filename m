    [XFS] remove dmapi cruft in xfs_file.c
    
    The dmapi cruft in xfs_file.c is totally out of date in mainline vs
    CVS, and at this point just removing this code which can't be used on
    mainline at all seems to be the best option to keep it maintainable.

    [XFS] allow enabling CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG
    
    Back when I first submitted XFS for mainline inclusion we made the
    decision that the debug code is far to extensive to be accidentally
    enabled by users in mainline.  But then again it's often quite useful
    to track problems down and hacking the makefile all the time is rather
    annoying.  Given all the debug options with even more overhead like
    lockdep or DEBUG_PAGE_ALLOC users (or rather developers) should know
    by now what they're doing.

commit 359346a9655c8800408ed3ca44517ac7ea95c197
Author: David Chinner <dgc@sgi.com>
Date:   Tue Apr 29 12:53:32 2008 +1000

    [XFS] Don't initialise new inode generation numbers to zero
    
    When we allocation new inode chunks, we initialise the generation numbers
    to zero. This works fine until we delete a chunk and then reallocate it,
    resulting in the same inode numbers but with a reset generation count.
    This can result in inode/generation pairs of different inodes occurring
    relatively close together.
    
    Given that the inode/gen pair makes up the "unique" portion of an NFS
    filehandle on XFS, this can result in file handles cached on clients being
    seen on the wire from the server but refer to a different file. This
    causes .... issues for NFS clients.
    
    Hence we need a unique generation number initialisation for each inode to
    prevent reuse of a small portion of the generation number space. Use a
    random number to initialise the generation number so we don't need to keep
    any new state on disk whilst making the new number difficult to guess from
    previous allocations.

    [XFS] Don't double count reserved block changes on UP.
    
    On uniprocessor machines, the incore superblock is used for all in memory
    accounting of free blocks. in this situation, changes to the reserved
    block count are accounted twice; once directly and once via
    xfs_mod_incore_sb(). Seeing as the modification on SMP is done via
    xfs_mod_incore_sb(), make this the only update mechanism that UP uses as
    well.

    Similar to to the previous patch for remove and rmdir only grab a
    reference to inodes when we join them to transaction to balance the
    decrement on transaction completion. Everything else it taken care of by
    the VFS.
    
    Note that the old case had leaks of inode count when src == target or src
    or target == one of the parent inodes, but these cases are fortunately
    already rejected by the VFS.

    [XFS] remove manual lookup from xfs_rename and simplify locking
    
    ->rename already gets the target inode passed if it exits. Pass it down to
    xfs_rename so that we can avoid looking it up again. Also simplify locking
    as the first lock section in xfs_rename can go away now: the isdir is an
    invariant over the lifetime of the inode, and new_parent and the nlink
    check are namespace topology protected by i_mutex in the VFS. The projid
    check needs to move into the second lock section anyway to not be racy.
    
    Also kill the now unused xfs_dir_lookup_int and remove the now-unused
    first_locked argumet to xfs_lock_inodes.

    isolated the XFS codebase from mrlock internals. That way we can kill
    mrlock_t entirely once rw_semaphores grow an islocked facility. Also
    remove unused flags to the ilock family of functions.

    [XFS] kill di_mode checks after xfs_iget
    
    Unless XFS_IGET_CREATE is passed xfs_iget will return ENOENT if it
    encounters an inode with di_mode == 0. Remove the duplicated checks in the
    callers.
    
    (the log recovery case is not touched for now)

    [XFS] kill xfs_getattr
    
    It's currently used by the ACL code to read di_mode/di_uid, but these are
    simple 32bit scalar values we can just read directly without locking.

    [XFS] Remove VN_IS* macros and related cruft.
    
    We can just check i_mode / di_mode directly.
