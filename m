Once an ABI is set in stone, there's very little that can be done on 
lkml to review the ABI in any serious way.

VMware has repeatedly done this in the past.  Ship a product with their 
own drivers, then submit something to lkml saying that the ABI cannot be 
changed because it's present in a shipping product.

I'll admit, Xen hasn't been as bad as VMware in this regard, but it's 
certainly not perfect either.
