As a starting point, consider creating a "scst" bus_type. Then make
sure all devices you need are uniquely named, so they can be in a flat
list in /sys/bus/scst/devices/.

Then add all the devices as struct_device to the tree, maybe use an
existing parent struct_device (like a pci device) if you have one, or
create a custom one in /sys/devices/ if there is nothing to use.

All the devices you add will show up in a hierarchy in /sys/devices/
depending on the parent information you supply, and every single
device of your subsystem will be listed in a flat list in
/sys/bus/scst/devices/*. You will also get proper events for userspace
that way.

The question is where the actual block devices hang off, and if they
can use one of the created scst devices, or if they will be virtual
ones?

Thanks,
Kay
