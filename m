Not sure what to do about this.  The intent is to provide the external reference
to the fips_enabled flag (which is either defined as an extern in or #defined to
0 dependent on CONFIG_CRYPTO_FIPS).  I can cut'n'paste the code block from the
include file and put it in here, but that seems like a worse solution to me.
Let me know your thoughts, and I can change this accordingly.

As for the other comments, they all seem good to me, let me know what you want
to do about the above, and I'll respin/repost the patch for you

Thanks!
Neil
