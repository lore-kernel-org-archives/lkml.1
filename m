Kame-san,

	I've been working on changes to the can_attach() code so it was pretty
easy to try this out.

	Don't let frozen tasks or cgroups change. This means frozen tasks can't
leave their current cgroup for another cgroup. It also means that tasks
cannot be added to or removed from a cgroup in the FROZEN state. We
enforce these rules by checking for frozen tasks and cgroups in the
can_attach() function.
