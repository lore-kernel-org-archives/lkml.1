Yes, it does.

I would not call it a "leak", since the blocks which got allocated as
part of the partial success of the fallocate syscall can be strictly
accounted for (i.e. they are assigned to a particular inode). And these
can be freed by the application, using a suitable @mode of fallocate.

Same is true for ext4 too. It is very difficult to keep track of which
uninitialized (unwritten) extents got allocated as part of the current
syscall. This is because, as David mentions, some of them might be
already present; and also because some of the older ones may have got
merged with the *new* uninitialized/unwritten extents as part of the
current syscall.

Right. This gives applications the free hand if they really want to use
the partially preallocated space, OR they want to free it; without
introducing additional complexity in the kernel.
