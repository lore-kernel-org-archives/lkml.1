I still don't think this is the right approach.

For link up/down events, those are direct pathing events and should be
signalled along a kernel notifier, not by mucking with the SCSI state
machine.  However, there's still devloss_tmo to consider ... even in
multipath, I don't think you want to signal path failure until
devloss_tmo has fired otherwise you'll get too many transient up/down
events which damage performance if the array has an expensive failover
model.

The other problem is what to do with in-flight commands at the time the
link went down.  With your current patch, they're still stuck until they
time out ... surely there needs to be some type of recovery mechanism
for these?
