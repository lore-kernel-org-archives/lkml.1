It is to be expected that there will be conflicts when making large-scale
changes like this while there is 25MB of unmerged diff sitting out in 50
different trees.  Doing it around the -rc1 time would be better.

Even better would be not doing it at all: add the necessary stuff into the
block core and then send the followup work to the relevant maintainers. ie:
standard practice.

Andi's tree is very out of date and is about to be damaged (to what extent
I don't yet know) by a xen merge.  I don't know if a) is going to happen.


Things are more than usually messy this time around.
