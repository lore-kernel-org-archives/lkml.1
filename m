Right.  I asked several people at Red Hat about the interface and I got a
"yeah, OK, whatever" kind of response.  Clearly you need to educate your
colleagues to pass these kinds of interface questions along to you.

It seems pretty elegant to me, actually.  There's no overhead after
you're done (unlike having a sysfs file, or even including a new ability
in a procfs file).

So ... if we sent a udev event when the scan list was empty, you'd be OK?

I don't quite understand why it was loaded, and not unloaded immediately.

That would rather miss the point, yes.
