Hello,
I'm working on the HP Smart Array SCSI driver (hpsa) and I'm seeing the
following failures:

hpsa1: <0x3230> at PCI 0000:02:00.0 IRQ 76 using DAC
scsi4 : hpsa

The illegal request is coming from smartd and probably doesn't mean anything
in this context since SA doesn't support the SCSI Report LUNs command. The
READ CAPACITY failures are what I'm concerned about. I can't seem to track
down why that's failing.
I've tried printing out the_result from sd but it's not printing out. I'm
assuming that anytime I load the driver it goes thru sd.

	if (the_result) {
		sense_valid = scsi_sense_valid(&sshdr);
		if (sense_valid &&
			sshdr.sense_key == ILLEGAL_REQUEST &&
			(sshdr.asc == 0x20 || sshdr.asc == 0x24) &&
			sshdr.ascq == 0x00)
			/* Invalid Command Operation Code or
			 * Invalid Field in CDB, just retry
			 * silently with RC10 */
			return -EINVAL;
		}
	retries--;
	} while (the_result && retries);
	printk(KERN_WARNING "sd-mfm: the_result = %d\n", the_result);

sd reports:
sd 4:0:0:0: [sdd] Result: hostbyte=DID_ABORT driverbyte=DRIVER_OK

>From the controllers serial port I see:

[04/08 14:31:09]Ctlr SCSI Request, Illegal CDB Opcode=0x0
[04/08 14:37:28]Volume SCSI Request, Illegal CDB Opcode=0xa0

when the driver loads. I guess the TUR is coming from sd. But neither of
these indicate why the READ CAPACITY (16) failed.

I've also tried printing out the command status from the driver but it only
shows a check condition with no sense.

Any ideas? Or is there not enough info here?

Thanks,
mikem
