There are different opinions whether the "complete source code" of the 
GPLv2 includes in such cases public keys, making it questionable whether 
your example will survive at court in all jurisdictions.

E.g. remember that gpl-violations.org has already successfully enforced 
the publication of public keys for "firmware only loads signed kernels" 
cases by threatening companies to otherwise take legal actions in 
Germany.
