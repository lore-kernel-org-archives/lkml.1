Subject: [patch 1/5] cio: Update documentation.
Content-Disposition: inline; filename=001-cio-docu.diff
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Cornelia Huck <cornelia.huck@de.ibm.com>

- read_dev_chars()/read_conf_data() are deprecated. Don't document them, but
  advise to issue the channel program from the driver itself.
- Remove some really obsolete and incorrect stuff.

-read_dev_chars() - Read Device Characteristics
-
-This routine returns the characteristics for the device specified.
-
-The function is meant to be called with the device already enabled; that is,

-The ccw_device must not be locked prior to calling read_dev_chars().

-The function may be called enabled or disabled.
-
-int read_dev_chars(struct ccw_device *cdev, void **buffer, int length );
-
-cdev   - the ccw_device the information is requested for.
-buffer - pointer to a buffer pointer. The buffer pointer itself
-         must contain a valid buffer area.
-length - length of the buffer provided.
-
-The read_dev_chars() function returns :
-
-      0 - successful completion
--ENODEV - cdev invalid
--EINVAL - an invalid parameter was detected, or the function was called early.
--EBUSY  - an irrecoverable I/O error occurred or the device is not
